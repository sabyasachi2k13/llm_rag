This year, CBC N.L. is continuing to partner with the Community Food Sharing Association, an organization that distributes to food banks across Newfoundland and Labrador year-round to help keep pantries stocked for people in need.&nbsp; Included is the annual Feed N.L. Day on Dec. 10, which in 2020 helped raise&nbsp;$193,815 for local food banks. Some community organizations across Newfoundland and Labrador are experiencing increased calls for help leading up to the holidays.&nbsp; Bridges to Hope and Food First N.L. both say more first-time food bank users are reaching out. Maj. Rene Loveless of the Salvation Army said families and individuals are making tough decisions every day on how to put food on their tables while trying to make ends meet.&nbsp; \"When it comes to the increased cost of supplying food for their families, that's certainly a significant factor,\" he said.&nbsp; \"And it's a significant factor for us a provider as well. Our food dollar doesn't take us as far as it used to. So that's something that we're certainly seeing as well.&nbsp; Loveless said donations to his organization are going well so far this year. Last year,&nbsp;the Salvation Army helped 2,000 families over the holidays, he said, but added it's expected the need is going to increase by 15 per cent this time around. The annual Make the Season Kind campaign will be virtual again this year. The public can support the Community Food Sharing Association by making a donation online \u2013 please visit:  ."

    "body": "A University of Waterloo professor was one of 78 new appointees to the Order of Canada on Thursday. John Hirdes is a recognized leader in the fields of aging and health assessment systems. His screening systems have helped over six million Canadians be screened 21 million times to help improve their quality of life and care. The 62-year-old's appointment to the Order of Canada is an honour he said he's really excited about. \"As somebody who's a first generation Canadian, it's really rewarding to feel that sense of belonging and recognition from the country that took me on many years ago,\" he said. \"It's great to be able to contribute to making things better for everybody.\" Moving to Canada from Namibia when he was just five-years-old, Hirdes said his family experienced the typical immigrant struggle of working hard just to get by.&nbsp; At home and abroad As the first person in his family to attend university, Hirdes said he was scooped up in the fourth year of his undergraduate studies by his soon-to-be mentor, Dr. Bill Forbes, the founder of the gerontology department at the University of Waterloo. \"He grabbed me by the scruff of the neck and said, 'OK, what do you want to do in your career? What would you like to do to make a difference?'\" Since then and over the course of his nearly 35-year career, Hirdes has been recognized as a fellow with the Royal Canadian Society, and the Canadian lead to InterRAI, a multinational research group that implements healthcare screening services across the globe.&nbsp; Hirdes&nbsp;and his team are currently trying to&nbsp;introduce&nbsp;the use of mental health assessment systems in India. They are also working to&nbsp;improve primary care for older adults in 11 African nations. \"I'm also very actively involved in mental health research in Canada and internationally. So we're hoping to launch a similar international study around mental health services in South America, the Caribbean and Central America, where we have several collaborators there as well.\" 'Freak of nurture' Hirdes said it was through different mentors and great support at home that he was able to develop a career that had an impact. \"My parents put a lot of emphasis on my brothers and I getting a post secondary education.\" When reflecting on his new Order of Canada appointment, Hirdes mentioned reading a book by a U.S.-based organizational psychologist named Adam Grant that talks about how people achieve things in their lives. \"[The book says] we have&nbsp;this misconception that people are born with an innate ability. And the reality is, we get to where we are because of many different factors coming together,\" Hirdes said. \"And so [Grant] says we should stop thinking that people who achieve things are freaks of nature. They're actually freaks of nurture.\" \"I'm happy to consider myself a freak of nurture.\""

I feel very fortunate that we're able to get back and able to get Growlers hockey back here in Newfoundland,\" he said. \"It seems like there's been quite a good buzz around the city with the excitement of having hockey games come back and we'll hopefully bring another exciting team to the ice.\" The training camp continues until Tuesday, ahead of the team's first game of the season on the road against the Trois-Rivi\u00e8res Lions on Thursday."

    "body": "Fifteen years ago, the Regina SWAT team could go 18 months without being called out once. But as of June of this year, in response to a growing gang problem in the city, it had been called into action 29 times.&nbsp; At the same time, the city police force has also bought a $375,000 armoured vehicle and decided to put semi-automatic rifles in every patrol car. Experts, however,&nbsp;tell&nbsp;  there are other solutions. \"When you move into a community because of violence, you are overwhelmingly moving into a community of colour, and their experience with the police and the law has been long, historic and toxic,\" said David Kennedy, a criminologist at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York. \"You do not want to show up in communities like that wearing body armour and masks and in armoured personnel carriers while carrying automatic weapons.\" Kennedy sees another way to approach the issue. He is one of the creators of \"The Boston Miracle,\" or what's now known as Operation Ceasefire, an approach to reducing gang violence born in Boston in the 1990s, when youth homicides in the city had spiralled out of control. In less than a decade following the launch of the program, the people behind it reported that youth homicides in Boston decreased by 63 per cent. \"We could not believe what happened was real,\" said Kennedy.&nbsp; The approach does not involve adding to the police arsenal, and instead focuses on targeting the few individuals perpetrating the majority of crimes and offering them options: leave the gang, accept help in the form of education, jobs, social support and training or face the full weight of the law.&nbsp; But so far, consideration of that kind of approach has not found many proponents within the Regina Police Service \u2014 or many other police services in Canada. Regina Police defend their decisions to add firepower, saying their officers need the new tools to protect themselves and the community.&nbsp; According to Regina Police, violent gun offences in Regina increased 25 per cent in the last year alone, while the number of gun-related injuries jumped 41 per cent. As of late August 2019, Regina had the highest amount of crime in the city in a decade.&nbsp; In 2018, Regina's crime rate was triple that of Toronto.&nbsp;        \"The reality is we work very hard to be out in the community, to be professional, to be approachable, to be the opposite of militarization,\" said Regina Police Chief Evan Bray. He acknowledges SWAT team use has spiked, but says that is far outweighed by officers' positive interactions with the public. \"What I always talk about is hundreds of thousands of contacts in the year with our front-line officers and I think we need to focus on the good work that's being done there, but recognize that every once in a while, we have to be police officers.\"&nbsp; Bray also points to his service's extensive outreach programs that include a team of community engagement officers, along with events like Coffee with a Cop and an annual barbecue to honour Tamra Keepness, a five-year-old girl who went missing in 2004.&nbsp; The police service says the additional firepower is also a response to the 2014 Moncton shootings that killed three RCMP officers and injured two.&nbsp; Regina Police spokesperson Elizabeth Popowich says the new weaponry \"comes not only out of meeting the threat of firearms in our community, but a legal obligation to provide adequate equipment and training for police officers.\" The bulk of the crime in Regina is centred in one neighborhood known as North Central, which is home to four main street gangs \u2014 Indian Mafia, Native Syndicate, Saskatchewan Warriors and Native Syndicate Killers. It's a neighbourhood where&nbsp;more than half of the residents live below the poverty line and more than half aren't employed. Several houses are boarded up and abandoned. Garbage and used needles litter many back alleys. Police vehicles can often be seen buzzing through the neighborhood.            According to Regina Police, methamphetamine seizures have gone up 2,100 per cent in the last four years.&nbsp; \"It's pretty crazy out there,\" Ryan Varley told  &nbsp; Varley grew up in North Central and joined a street gang when he was 11 years old. He went on to become a leader of the Native Syndicate gang.&nbsp; \"In this area, you've got to be able to fight going out the door,\" he said. \"It's just a matter of time before you get involved in the drugs. You're around them enough, you're going to get addicted, right?\u2026&nbsp; Even to this day, I'm still struggling in recovery. \"I had a lot of close friends that died just recently \u2026 from drugs and violence.\" Varley was sentenced to a total of 10 years in prison for crimes ranging from breaking and entering and assault to unlawful confinement. He admits he was involved with violence and caused a lot of hurt when he was with the gang.&nbsp; \"I live with that regret, the pain that I caused people.\"&nbsp; Varley recently left the gang and has decided to speak out about his experiences in hope that it might help others leave gang life behind. \"I feel that it's something that I had do \u2026 to show [current gang members] there's a better way, and the only way we can get there is to talk about it, to let people know&nbsp;and to let people see that people do change.\" A beacon of hope in the neighborhood comes in the form of a group of mostly Indigenous women who patrol the streets, collecting used needles, handing out food and raising the spirits of community members. It's called White Pony Lodge.&nbsp; So far this year, White Pony Lodge volunteers have found 24,445 dangerous items during their weekly patrols \u2014 a sharp increase from the 4,972 they found in 2016. \"I want people to know that North Central is full of good people,\" Leticia Racine, one of the group's founding members, said while out on a community patrol.&nbsp; \"It's not a place to be scared of, it's a place to come and bring your good energy,\" she said. \"We need people not to judge us and to be fearful of us. As a community, we need people to have compassion and love and prayers and good energy and good thoughts. I love North Central.\" Racine is looking for solutions to curb the violence in her neighborhood and believes Operation Ceasefire could be the answer. \"I think that's something that we could do as well as a community,\" she said. \"There's absolutely no reason why we can't do that here.\" The program is a systematic approach to gang violence that involves a series of what are referred to as \"call-ins.\" The most violent gang members, often just a handful of people in a city, are invited to meet with the police, social service and spiritual leaders. Gang members are given a choice: put down your guns and accept help or face the full force of the law. The key to the program, say its creators, is collaboration. Spiritual leaders, social services and the police need to work together, they say. \"I think one of the key things for all of the parties, especially the police, was to come out of our comfort zone,\" Bob Merner, a police officer in Boston in the 1990s and one of the creators of Operation Ceasefire, said during a recent visit to Regina. Merner said police had to realize they \"weren't just law enforcement, lock 'em up \u2014 you know, arrest and enforce. We had an opportunity to look at the bigger problem, but we also had an opportunity to look at the individual [gang members] as people.\"  has been used successfully around the world, including in the United States, Brazil, Sweden and Britain, according to the National Network of Safe Communities \u2014 the body that runs the program. The program has been running in Oakland, Calif., since 2012. That year, the city had 553 shootings and 125 homicides, but after five years of Ceasefire, it reported a 49 per cent decrease in shootings and a 42 per cent decrease in homicides. Elements of Operation Ceasefire have been tried in Canada, but never the full program.&nbsp;  recently hosted a community forum in Regina, where the question was posed: Could it work here? \"There are principles that underlie our efforts in Boston that are translatable,\" said Rev. Jeffrey Brown, who travelled from Boston to Regina for the forum and is one of the creators of the program. \"I've been around the United States, in large, medium and small cities, taking those principles and they've morphed into \u2026 what was appropriate for their community. And so I would say yes, absolutely [it could work in Regina].\" Regina's police chief says he's \"inspired\" by the program, but collaboration on this scale isn't cheap.&nbsp; \"It's not going to be a straight line to success,\" he said. \"There's going to be stumbles. But that takes time and ... it takes a lot of energy and a lot of resources.\" The advice from those who have done it: Don't wait for funding. If you build it, they will come. \"As it started to get successful [in Boston], the mayor bought in,\" said Merner. \"Then [we] got to meet on numerous times with then-U.S. President Bill Clinton. Once the success started to take place, they started to fund us, as opposed to the other way around.\"&nbsp;"

    "body": "For the last 10 years, Wei Xu has lived in the same Toronto rental, a house she now shares with her partner. When she first moved in, Xu was in her early 20s, and the space was already furnished \u2014&nbsp;a detail that might prove irksome if you're the type who itches to experiment with maximalism or hygge or any other decor trend.&nbsp; Xu is definitely that sort of person, and as she approaches her 32nd birthday, she still dreams of nesting in style. But until she has the necessary space, and salary, to accommodate a living room straight out of Architectural Digest, she has found another way to make do. She's become a DIY expert, perfecting everything from metal-smithing to carpentry \u2014 skills that are helping her realize her vision \u2026 at a fraction of the size. Xu is a miniaturist, and she sees the world in&nbsp;1:12 scale. Anything can be rendered at a ratio of one inch to one foot, but she has a special interest in cozy interiors. She builds little reading nooks, little bathrooms, little boudoirs: spaces that are infinitely cuter than the ones we actually inhabit. And by sweating the small stuff \u2014 literal small stuff \u2014 she's discovered something that so many others have as well: creating mini homes can make our full-sized lives feel more manageable. A former business analyst, Xu was already a skilled crafter when she began pursuing miniatures in 2019, and her hobby quickly became a way to experiment with ideas she couldn't pursue in a rented house. \"I explore what my personal tastes are,\" she explains, and if she's working on a new mini, chances are it's a replica of something that will forever languish in her online shopping cart. On Instagram, she posts photos of her work under the brand name  . Her profile is full of&nbsp;petite scalloped armchairs and hand-woven baskets no bigger than a dime. House plants are an especially popular item in her  , where she sells hand-made furnishings.&nbsp; In fact, Xu now makes her living as a miniaturist \u2014 though the shop isn't her main source of income. Rather, she works as a freelance content creator, collaborating with outside companies to bring their tiny visions to life. The scenes she creates for the lifestyle brand  , for example, live on Instagram next to the sort of domestic eye-candy that fuelled Xu's home-decor cravings to start with. It's as if to prove miniature interiors can be just as impossibly alluring as the real deal \u2014 maybe moreso, considering we're still waiting on the invention of the shrink ray.&nbsp; Big interest in little things Minis are, at the very least, similarly popular \u2014 or they are on social media, where Xu's Honey Thistle account has more than 33,000 followers. Tiny things are coveted by collectors, a mix of dollhouse enthusiasts and ordinary folk \u2014 the mini curious, let's call them, people who might drop $30 on an itsy-bitsy couch just because it looks adorbs. (Search \"miniature sofa\" on Etsy and you'll find nearly 4,000 to choose from.)&nbsp; And Friday, a whole new reality show featuring some of the world's top mini-makers will debut on CBC Gem.   follows a familiar competition format; think   or  , except everyone's furnishing a custom dollhouse.        Is there an outsized interest in miniatures? Kat Picot of Brighton, U.K., has been blogging about the pastime since the early 2010s, and as the founder of  &nbsp; \u2014 \"a modern miniatures magazine\" \u2014 she has a special interest in whether minis are truly trending. Still, in her observation, there's no denying the pursuit has evolved in recent years. Tools that allow crafters greater precision are now easier to come by: 3D printers, Cricut machines. There's the whole rise of social media to factor in \u2014 Instagram especially, and Picot credits Shrunk's existence to the community that's proliferated on that platform. Her quarterly magazine, which was launched through a 2020 Kickstarter campaign, met its goal of 1,500 pounds in 24 hours. \"That was purely the power of Instagram,\" says Picot. \"There was no content; the magazine didn't exist\" \u2014&nbsp;but a photo was enough to generate support. And then there's the third, not-so-secret reason why minis are having a moment. \"To be honest, the pandemic really gave it a bit of an injection,\" says Picot. It's a time-consuming hobby, and for those who were lucky enough to be idle while self-isolating, miniatures were a potential diversion, she says. Even just looking at minis offers \"a bit of escapism.\" When she was developing Shrunk, Picot was picturing something closer to an aspirational lifestyle mag than a journal for dollhouse purists. And the magazine's esthetic leans toward&nbsp;current design trends with a touch of whimsy.&nbsp; \"Creating cool interiors: that was the crux of Shrunk. When I started it, I just wanted it to look like a cool interiors magazine \u2014 except everything would be tiny,\" says Picot. \"Like, interiors we would love to live in ourselves, furniture we aspire to own.\" The ultimate small-space solution?  gets it. For the Toronto-based graphic designer, everything about miniatures is aspirational. A former  , Vianzon also appears on  , where she's introduced as a skilled  . And though she's relatively new to making minis herself \u2014 she began dabbling in 2019 \u2014 she's collected tiny objects from specialty shops for the last 15 years. \"Miniatures, for me, are [about] having things that I can't get in everyday life,\" she says \u2014 things like her most recent purchase: an array of KitchenAid mixers in colours to suit every mood. \"In miniature I can have as many as I like,\" she laughs. \"You know what I mean? It's like living a dream in the world of miniature. So that's why I love doing it.\" Never mind the money saved when your obsession is pint-sized replicas \u2014 there's a practical side to miniatures if your quarters are on the compact side. Vianzon, for example, lives in a two-bedroom apartment with her family. There's no room for a home art studio, much as she'd love to have one. For now, the tiny pottery wheel she uses is just the right size for an apartment; she can drop it on the coffee table and throw a few bowls while watching Netflix. If the situation were different, she might be making full-scale ceramics in her downtime. But miniatures suit the realities of small-space living, while allowing her to pursue any number of craft techniques \u2014 skills she'll put to use while building the (miniature) home of her dreams. And yes, she has a tiny studio, complete with its own kiln.&nbsp;   It's this aspirational thing ... I'll make a miniature for now to tide me over.     Aubrey Srnec's passion for minis actually began as a tribute to her cramped Toronto apartment \u2014 her \"teeny tiny\" living room, specifically. In 2019, Srnec, who works as a visual merchandiser for Hudson's Bay,&nbsp;began replicating every detail of her 8 x 10 space in miniature, right down to her Kleenex box. It was purely meant to be a creative outlet \u2014 a hobby inspired by some intriguing minis she'd noticed online \u2014 and the results were documented on Instagram ( ).&nbsp; Since then, she's become a little obsessed. Everything she sees has the potential to get shrunk, and if she'd kept updating her living-room diorama, it would've spun into a Droste effect nightmare. \"My living room is just full of miniature supplies. I'd be making tiny miniatures of miniatures!\"&nbsp; Recently, Srnec's found herself chasing projects that scratch the same materialistic itch that was nagging Xu. \"It's this aspirational thing \u2014 like, all these like cool pieces that I would love to own one day, but I'll make a miniature for now to tide me over.\" Sure, the cost&nbsp;is one thing holding her back from, say, splurging on an actual shelving unit, but there's the simple reality of square-footage to consider. If she wanted to, she could put the same fabrication skills to use and make a full-sized dupe of a cult design. But where would she put it? \"I just don't have any space. That's my problem,\" she laughs. \"I would have a huge collection of real-life chairs if I could.\" More to the fantasy than furniture  loves furniture, too. A freelance graphic designer, she's also the founder of  , a Toronto company that specializes in restoring and reimagining&nbsp;(full-size) vintage furnishings. But during the earliest days of the pandemic, lockdown restrictions kept Brathwaite out of her workshop. Stuck at home, with more free time than she could use, she began making tiny furniture instead.&nbsp; Like Vianzon, Brathwaite appears on the new competition series  . On the program, her signature style is marked by a love of mid-century modern design and textures that draw you in: fluffy natural textiles, overflowing shelves, richly coloured woods. \"If you were to walk into my place, I think you would get the same kind of vibe,\" says Brathwaite. You'd also find an enviable collection of teak furniture, by the sounds of it. When Brathwaite makes minis for herself, she usually replicates her own things. And since throwing herself into the hobby in early 2020, she's evolved it into more of an art practice, building \"miniature suites\" to raise social and environmental issues. A series appeared at Toronto's   last year. But there's still something aspirational about what she does. Building a home, even a miniature one, is about more than what you stuff inside it.&nbsp; \"One of my objectives is just to create a warm, inviting environment,\" says Brathwaite. Home is more than a material thing; it's a state of mind, she says. And in June of 2020, as the Black Lives Matter protests broke out, she says she began channelling her feelings \u2014 \"anger, fear, frustration\" \u2014 into the tiny suite she was crafting. \"I started thinking about this whole concept of the home being a safe place. Like, who is it safe for?\"&nbsp; While building a miniature living room, she reflected on things that bring comfort. She imagined a space where she could drink tea with friends, listen to music&nbsp;or maybe just read a magazine in peaceful solitude. \"[It's] just someplace that's really safe and comfortable and inspiring and creative.\"&nbsp; No matter what's happening in the full-sized world, there's something about miniatures that forces a different perspective. For Vianzon, miniatures are a home within a home. After a long day, she retreats to her collection. \"After doing household chores, I enter my room and my miniatures are there \u2014 my mini groceries, my miniature kitchen. It's the same household chores I'm doing every day, but they're in miniature size,\" she laughs. \"When I see them, there's just a smile on [my] face.\" Making miniatures has been something of an escape for Xu too, though she wonders if her habits might change this year. She and her partner have been busy the last few months with a life-size home-reno project. \"I will be moving to my own home \u2014 finally \u2014 in maybe a few months.\" \"Maybe the miniature content will decrease,\" she laughs. \"We will see.\""

    "body": "Getting to the top of Greenlaw Mountain, just north of Saint Andrews, N.B., isn't easy. The road to the summit isn't exactly the dictionary definition of a road. The gravel single lane winds its way through thick woods, with several steep sections to test the four-wheel drive vehicle, and deep washouts that force the driver to use every inch of the narrow road to avoid the holes. Once you reach the cell tower at the top, a short walk north through the woods brings you into a clearing, which presents a spectacular view of the St. Croix River valley. But the people who spend their days here through much of the late summer and early fall are more interested in what they see when they look up. Todd Watts is the official counter of Hawk Watch, a program that gathers data on the migration numbers of hawks and other raptors. Watts went looking for a good place to do that in 2008, after moving to the area from the U.S.. \"It was a targeted effort, so I was looking for a naturally occurring concentration point for these birds of prey,\" Watts said. \"And I came up here after checking a bunch of other local places, and this turned out to be the best spot around \u2014 one of the best places in Atlantic Canada.\" &nbsp; Watts said raptors are difficult to observe in their natural habitat, so the regular methods of counting birds aren't effective. \"With other species of birds you can conduct breeding bird surveys. You can go out in the forest or in the field where they breed and conduct a survey and get a good estimate of the number of birds that are there,\" he said. \"But, birds of prey, you can't do that. They don't announce their territory by calling, by singing, like many other birds and their nests are extremely difficult to find in the forest. So really the only way to document population status of birds of prey is to count them in migration.\" An ideal location Greenlaw Mountain isn't open to the public. It sits on private land, accessed by a private road. CBC has been invited here by the Saint John Naturalist Club, which runs the program. Hank Scarth, the volunteer chair of Hawk Watch, said Greenlaw Mountain is a perfect geographical location for observing the migration.&nbsp; \"It's sort of at the mouth of the Bay of Fundy before you hit the Maine-U.S. land mass. So the birds are migrating down the coast and they don't want to go over the water and this particular site is right on that line,\" Scarth said. Watts and his team of a few dozen volunteers will be here into the month of November, whenever weather conditions are right, working from&nbsp;a small wooden platform. This part of September is prime time for migration, especially broad-winged hawks.&nbsp; Despite having cooler temperatures and north winds 15&nbsp;\u2014&nbsp;two of the conditions the birds like for migrating south&nbsp;\u2014&nbsp;there are few sightings this day. Heavy winds affect migration Watts suspects the wind gusts, which are 80 kilometres per hour, are to blame. \"The stronger winds tend to keep the birds down, especially the smaller birds. They don't weigh as much, so they get thrown around by these heavy winds,\" Watts said \"And it becomes really inefficient for them to travel. They want to travel when they can burn the fewest calories. And heavy wind conditions [are] just not right for that.\" Despite that, a tiny American kestrel, the smallest falcon on the continent, appears not far above the trees, and quickly glides off toward Maine. Soon after, two&nbsp;bald eagles come into view, high in the sky. They circle over the mountain, gaining altitude, before also heading into the St. Croix River valley. A pair of turkey vultures catch the volunteers' attention, but because they show no signs of leaving the area, Watts treats them as local birds and doesn't include them in the migration counts. Volunteer effort is critical The weather can hold up migration for days, until a sudden shift comes and opens a floodgate of raptors that have been waiting to take flight. That's when Watts can use all the volunteer help he can get. \"They could be anywhere in the sky and at various altitudes from just above sea level to a kilometre or two high,\" Watts said. \"Best day we ever had was last year on the 14th of September. We had a little over 5,000 individual hawks pass this point that we saw \u2014 those are the birds that we saw \u2014 there were probably others that we didn't manage to actually observe.\" On busy days, Scarth said 20 or more volunteers will be on site to help. \"That's where our official counter really needs the help, just getting eyes on the birds and then he can deal with the identification because the identification of these hawks at a distance is really something that takes a lot of experience and work.\" Watts also enlists the help of the black-capped chickadees that live on Greenlaw Mountain.&nbsp; He has a feeder filled with seed at the edge of the woods to keep the chickadees close. \"The chickadees, when they see a bird of prey, they'll give off a warning call and that alerts me to the presence of the bird of prey. So I know to look up.\" In 14 years, the group has seen species like the bald eagle and the peregrine falcon make a comeback, but some smaller species, like the American kestrel,&nbsp;haven't been doing as well. Watts suspects a connection with&nbsp;a decline in songbirds and insects, both prey of the little birds. The migration season of 2021 was a record year for the program, sighting more than 9,000 birds of prey from September to November, made up of 17 different species. They likely come from across the Maritimes and the Gasp\u00e9. Scarth said all the data gathered goes into a massive database managed by the Hawk Migration Association of North America. \"That's about 300 sites of hawk watches across North America, into Mexico even, and that data is then consolidated there and it's available without charge to science research, to public groups, to individuals,\" he said. Since Greenlaw Mountain is the only regularly monitored&nbsp;hawk watch in the Maritime provinces, it is adding important information that otherwise wouldn't be available. &nbsp;\"If you love and respect something, you want to look after it,\" Scarth&nbsp;said. \"It's one small way that I and certainly members of the Saint John Naturalist Club can help out in support of conservation\u2026 you know, it provides that reward that you're doing something, small as it might be.\""

    "body": "The first indication Cal Craig had that his Bonny River home might be in danger of flooding came early on the morning of Dec. 14, 2010. At around 1 a.m., his phone rang. It was his cousin, calling to say \"the water was coming up pretty fast.\" The retired RCMP officer went outside and moved his car and his camper van to higher ground. He also put a few things in his garage on top of his lawn tractor, just in case any water seeped in there. Craig&nbsp;and his wife, Barb, had lived there for 17 years, and while the meadow in front of his home often flooded during the spring freshet in the Magaguadavic River, it was built on the far edge of the flood plain, according to current flood maps. Built on a concrete pad, with only a crawl space and a small root cellar, flooding had never been a problem. So&nbsp;he headed back to bed. When daylight came, it quickly became clear that this was no ordinary rainstorm. The meadow was under water. So was the driveway. In the garage, where Craig had carefully placed a few items on top of his lawn tractor to keep them dry, there was now five feet of water. The tractor was two feet below the surface. And the water was rapidly encroaching on his house. \"My neighbour came up with his canoe and managed to free up the dinghy I had tied up, and he brought it over to the door,\" Craig said. \"I really didn't want to go, but I wanted to get my wife out. She had just had a back surgery and wasn't feeling very well.\" But Craig's neighbour was having none of that talk. \"He said 'If you don't go now, you won't be able to go'.\" The couple got in the small boat, and Craig, then 74 years old, began rowing it up the submerged driveway. That's when he realized this was no quiet pool of water \u2014 it was a raging river. \"The current was so strong, it swept us across the lot. I was rowing like hell,\" Craig said. If it hadn't been for a cluster of trees on the property next door, he said, they might not have made it to higher ground. \"We'd probably still be going,\" he said with a chuckle. Rain across the province The heavy rains cut a swath through the west and centre of the province. The St. John River flooded at Fredericton, closing roads throughout the downtown. Northwest of the capital, the Keswick River blew its banks, and 30 people in Zealand and Burtts Corner had to be rescued from their homes. A large stretch of the main road through the two communities was washed out. The hole created was reported to be 4.5 metres deep and almost 400 metres in length. One mini-home was completely swept away in the floodwaters. The roads in and out of the community of Hoyt were also washed out, and 40 people had to be evacuated from their homes. Both St. Stephen and McAdam declared local states of emergency, and the town of St. George had to evacuate homes from the floodwaters of the Magaguadavic River. Water was so high, the town's famous dam became an unexpected draw for winter sightseers as water poured over the top of the dam into the gorge below. The province went to work dealing with the aftermath, but in Charlotte County, Bonny River wasn't on the radar yet. St. Stephen had received 167 millimetres of rain in 24 hours. It swamped roads into the town and submerged businesses, and EMO focused its efforts there.&nbsp; The situation in St. George was similar. But EMO officials said that when the residents of Bonny River got into trouble, many of them called on neighbours with boats, or contacted Cooke Aquaculture, the biggest local employer with a fleet of boats, for help. So there was no spike of 911 calls to warn the province of the issues in Bonny River and its sister community Second Falls. At Cooke Aquaculture, however, calls were coming in. Ted Weaire, a manager for Cooke, said that when the company heard&nbsp;that people were stranded, CEO Glenn Cooke immediately made the decision to respond.&nbsp; \"We have the luxury of having a lot of boats,\" Weaire said.&nbsp;\"We had qualified, confident, competent, calm people who could do the work without causing damage to boats, or homes, or people.\" Weaire said it was important to have people who knew how to handle a boat, how to safely approach a home, and how to safely get people, many of them in shock, out and onboard. Those crews headed into the cut-off community and an unforgettable experience. \"It's hard for people to grasp the magnitude of it,\" Weaire said. \"The visual aspect of it, when you're talking a boat with an outboard motor and you're taking it up roads \u2014 major roads \u2014&nbsp;that's when it sinks in.\" Lost in the mix Rick Doucet was the Liberal MLA for the area at the time. He remembers being in the legislature when his cellphone started to blow up with calls about Bonny River.&nbsp;Government officials had no idea what was going on there. During a break, Doucet&nbsp;walked across the floor to talk to then public safety minister Robert Trevors about what he was hearing. The next day, he joined the crew of a Cooke Aquaculture boat and took a trip into Bonny River. By now, the only way to get there was by boat. \"It was pretty sad to see,\" he recalled.&nbsp;\"People were in tears.&nbsp; \"We went into a house and, in the basement, there was a Christmas tree and gifts floating around in the water.\" Doucet recalled seeing empty homes, surrounded by water, with Christmas lights still on because the power had not been shut off. Some residents left their homes wearing only pajamas, he said. On Dec. 15, then-Premier David Alward flew over Bonny River in a helicopter. By then, the Red Cross had also been alerted to the magnitude of the flooding. Bill Lawlor, now New Brunswick and P.E.I. director of the Canadian Red Cross, was in charge of its disaster management program in 2010. The Red Cross set up at the Family Worship Centre in St. George, which became the headquarters for an operation that included Cooke Aquaculture, J.D. Irving, and EMO, and another shelter at the Bonny River fire hall in the trapped community. For Lawlor, the&nbsp;operation hit home on a personal level, because there was a real sense of community involvement. Because of that, the Red Cross adopted new ways of doing things that have stuck to this day. The use of host families to take in people who couldn't return home, for example, was a first for the Red Cross. Lawlor said almost 60 families came forward to volunteer their homes to people&nbsp;affected by the flooding. He&nbsp;said some didn't really have the resources to take in a family, but they volunteered nonetheless. There was also an unprecedented involvement of corporations. \"And it was not just financial support, but resources as well,\" Lawlor said. \"There was not a day I didn't see Glenn Cooke.\" Corporate help Both Cooke Aquaculture and J.D. Irving provided support beyond the early rescue effort. The companies bought Christmas gifts for families who had lost theirs in the flood, and employees wrapped them. Lawlor said Cooke held a Christmas celebration at the local hotel, putting families up and providing a tree and gifts for them.&nbsp; As people returned to the area to survey the damage, both companies provided pumps, dryers and dehumidifiers to help with the cleanup. Electricians came in to replace electrical systems destroyed by water. Well water was flushed and tested. For Cal Craig, all of that was done for free.&nbsp; Craig and his wife spent a couple of days sleeping in their camper van, which they had rescued from the rising waters, but returned to their home on Dec. 16. He calls that experience \"pretty discouraging.\" In some ways, they were luckier than most. Their house, being on the very edge of the flood plain, had three inches of water in the main floor of the house. Their log home had very little drywall, just two walls' worth, so it didn't need to be gutted. But the crawl space and root cellar below the main floor were completely flooded, and the hardwood floors were badly warped.&nbsp; To this day, there are still water marks on the walls. When asked what the total&nbsp;damage tally was, Craig said he remembers signing a paper from his&nbsp;insurance company that contained the figure of $58,000, which included a 25-day stay in a local hotel. But other Bonny River residents lost everything, or their properties were considered too flood-prone to make rebuilding feasible. Six families were moved to a subdivision on land owned partly by Cooke Aquaculture and partly by the town of St. George. J.D. Irving provided modular homes for the families. Was the dam partly to blame? Many people in the area believe the hydroelectric dam on the Magaguadavic River&nbsp;was at least partially responsible for the severity of the flooding. Craig thinks it might not have been as bad if St. George Power, which runs the dam that provides power to&nbsp;the Irving Lake Utopia mill, had opened the gates a few days earlier to reduce the size of the headpond. But, he said, while the company treated him well in the aftermath, it has never admitted the dam may have played a role in the flood. At the time, a company spokesperson told CBC News it manages the dam according to weather forecasts and water level information it receives.&nbsp;The company's spokesperson said they were caught off guard when the storm exceeded all expectations. The operations&nbsp;of the dam continue&nbsp;to be a sore spot with residents, although the company now provides water-level information through a recorded message line. Lessons learned The Red Cross would&nbsp;be involved with the people of Bonny River for nearly a year. Unfortunately, Bill Lawlor said, mortgages don't disappear because your house is gone, so arranging new homes isn't a simple process. The last family was moved out of their hotel room in late 2011 and into a new home. The organization raised $640,000 for the relief effort. \"There was a fair bit of reservation about the Red Cross [in the community],\" Lawlor said. But as they left St. George after completing their work there, Lawlor saw a sign at a local fast food restaurant. It simply said: Thank you, Red Cross. \"It really meant a lot.\" Ted Weaire of Cooke Aquaculture said that,&nbsp;to this day, the crews who worked to get people in and out of Bonny River are still involved in flood relief efforts around the province as volunteers. He said EMO learned that they need local businesses and organizations to help in situations like this. A government report into the event highlighted the value of local help. It also pinpointed problems with communication both within and outside government agencies. \"We have to be prepared,\" Weaire said, speaking about the role of the community in an emergency. \"Government is coming, but you can't plan to have the equipment ready for something like this. The community has to help themselves.\" There were many days and nights without sleep, and it took a huge toll&nbsp;on the people who volunteered to help. \"I'm glad it's never come back,\" Weaire said 10 years after the flood, \"but, it was a wonderful experience to be a part of it.\"&nbsp; Every so often, he runs&nbsp;into people he helped, \"just one person, or groups of like six to 10.\" \"Sometimes there's just a 'Hey!' \" he said. \"Sometimes there's a hug.\""

    "body": "COVID-19 forced a three-month halt to TV and film productions in Hamilton this year, but one new high-profile Netflix production showcases the city's versatility \u2014  . Netflix released season two of the popular show on July 31, and it features 38 locations around Hamilton, says Debbie Spence, the city's&nbsp;film business development consultant. Nearly all of them were designed to resemble Dallas, Texas. The show and its Hamilton crew of 120 generated about $20 million for the local economy last year, including restaurant meals and crew parting gifts, she said. That's about one third of&nbsp;the total $59 million film productions spent in Hamilton. All told, the show accounted for 38 of the 790&nbsp;location permits the city issued to a combined 138 productions last year, Spence said.&nbsp; COVID-19 forced the city to halt filming from April to June this year,&nbsp;but filming&nbsp;resumed July 6, she said. Since then, the city has issued 26 permits. So far this year, it's issued 143, and from April to June last year, it issued 209. So numbers are down, Spence said, but she's still optimistic. \"The good news is that since July 6, Hamilton&nbsp;has&nbsp;seen a solid&nbsp;number of productions and expect&nbsp;more to come in September through the end of this year,\" she said.&nbsp;\"Typically our busiest months for filming are July&nbsp;to October.\" Productions are treated like workplaces, she said, which means physical distancing is in effect. That means crews are spreading out, and need more holding spaces. The city has reached out to some local businesses \u2014 especially music venues&nbsp;\u2014 to see how they can get involved, she said. &nbsp;filmed in the following places:                                                                    Here are five&nbsp;spots you can't help but notice: 1. Ottawa Street. Again and again Season one of   featured plenty of Gore Park. The main characters lived there. They walked down the street there. They weathered a foreshadowed&nbsp;Gore Park apocalypse. Season two is full of Ottawa Street. It's the setting of an often-used diner, and hair salon, and appliance store. The alleys are used as restaurants and time travel portals. Episode one features even&nbsp;more apocalyptic visuals. The major change: when viewed facing the industrial area, the landscape has been modified to include&nbsp;the skyline of downtown Dallas. 2. City hall Hamilton's city hall is a building used by nefarious forces in season two, and it's not even particularly disguised. The characters enter through the back end of city hall. Inside, the decor is intact, including a&nbsp;large patterned wall leading to the council chambers. The main difference is a Tiki Lounge on one of the upper floors, which needless to say is not usually there. 3. Vienna Tavern The Vienna Tavern does double duty in  . On the inside, it serves as a bar that necromancer Klaus visits. On the outside, it serves as the Plano Street Rooming House for Solitary Men. 4. Emerald Street pedestrian bridge This metal bridge, which HistoricBridges.org says  ,&nbsp;connects Birge Street with Emerald Street North. In  , it shows up in episode nine. 5.&nbsp;765 Barton St E. A shop partially occupied by Furlan Conservation became a hardware store where Klaus makes a desperate attempt to change the course of history. And no, we can't elaborate. Season two again features Hamilton actor T.J. McGibbon as young Vanya, and used clothes from VintageSoulGeek in the International Village. Spence said Hamilton-filmed productions from 2019 are also due to show up on Hulu, Amazon, CTV, CBC, Discovery Channel, CNN and Global. &nbsp;"

During an update broadcast on YouTube Friday, Vera Etches, Ottawa's medical officer of health, estimated&nbsp;about 20 per cent of confirmed cases in the city were acquired through community transmission. She said transmission of the virus can occur&nbsp;before any&nbsp;symptoms.&nbsp; According to Ottawa Public Health (OPH), 1,753 people have tested positive for COVID-19 and 189 have died from the respiratory illness. The vast majority of positive cases are classified as resolved. Etches repeated her call for anyone with symptoms to get tested&nbsp;so health officials can get a sense of where and how the virus is spreading Currently, OPH is able to begin contact tracing for each new case&nbsp;within one&nbsp;day, 90 per cent of the time,&nbsp;Etches said. Classic symptoms of COVID-19 include&nbsp;coughing, a fever and difficulty breathing. Less common symptoms, according to OPH,&nbsp;include:&nbsp;a sore throat, difficulty swallowing, loss of taste and/or smell, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, pneumonia and a runny or stuffy nose. As the province begins taking steps to reopen the economy over the next few days, Etches urged&nbsp;people to wear a fabric or non-medical mask when they can't remain two metres apart from others. Continued physical distancing remains important to keep hospitalizations to a minimum, she said."

Neither is his wife, Harper (Aubrey Plaza) when she says, \"It's like we're all entertaining each other while the world burns, right?\" Thankfully, Watch This! is here to make the glut of TV content a little more curated and a little less suffocating. Because if we're going to be entertained while we wait for our inevitable demise, it may as well be with something good.&nbsp; (Also, the finale of   is on Dec. 11, and we are pumped for it. Who is the corpse in episode one!? Who!?) If you've ever watched   and thought, \"Man, I wish this saga was French instead,\" this series is for you. If you're familiar with French rap \u2014 and why would you be? This isn't Radio-Canada \u2014 then you know that Supr\u00eame NTM became famous in the 1990s for their gritty, unflinching portraits of violence and poverty in the public housing tower blocks in the Parisian suburbs, and   that  , released in French as  , is a dramatization of the duo's story. Taking place in the 1980s, it shows how&nbsp;Didier Morville (Melvin Boomer) and Bruno Lopes (Anthony Bajon) \u2014 two unassuming teenagers from the hardscrabble  &nbsp;of Saint-D\u00e9nis&nbsp;\u2014 eventually became the festival-headlining MCs and threats to the French state known as Joey Starr and Kool Shen.  Want to make your yuletide extra gay this December? Look no further than comedian Matt Rogers' holiday-themed comedy musical special, Rogers, who you may know from co-hosting the podcast&nbsp; &nbsp;with Bowen Yang or from his role on the series&nbsp; , has been performing these hilarious \u2014 and very catchy \u2014 original songs at his live holiday shows for years, and it is&nbsp;an absolute holiday treat to now be able to enjoy them from home. (Also, if you're in Toronto, you can also see Rogers  .)&nbsp; Based on the 2019 debut novel by journalist Taffy Brodesser-Akner,  &nbsp;is the story of Toby Fleishman (Jesse Eisenberg), a newly divorced 40-something father of two and hepatologist&nbsp;who finds himself the sole care provider for his two children when his high-powered theatre agent ex Rachel (Claire Danes) goes unexpectedly AWOL, causing him to spin out. Toby's college friend Libby (the always excellent Lizzy Caplan) acts as the show's narrator \u2014&nbsp;and then gets drawn into marital trouble of her own, as the Fleishmans' meltdown causes her to question her own life choices. This is a show where neither of the main characters are likable. Eisenberg is somehow simultaneously self-deprecating and self-aggrandizing, while Danes combines the petulance of Angela Chase with the high octane hostility&nbsp;of Carrie Mathison. Set against the backdrop of the 2016 presidential election,   is a deep dive into how money, ambition, class and gender can play off of one&nbsp;another and take people to dark places.  If the mission at Disney+ is to resurrect every IP with even a whiff of nostalgic interest, no shade there. In the last 12 months, they've rebooted properties so aligned with my cringingly specific millennial tastes ( ,  ) that I'm questioning whether the entire streamer's a simulation that's been engineered just for me. (If they greenlight a singing competition based on Disney Afternoon theme songs, that'll clinch it.) So,  . Who remembers it? It's a 1988 fantasy flick about a hobbit-y farmer (the titular Willow, played by Warwick Davis) who forms a crew of misfits (including Val Kilmer). Together, they fight evil \u2014 namely the witchy queen Bavmorda \u2014 and protect a child prophesied to save the realm. That's Elora Danan, a baby in a red wig whose name sounds like a fancy type of yogurt.&nbsp; Once upon a time, in the Blockbuster Video era, I confess I'd rent it on the regular along with every other '80s fantasy flick that gave me nightmares as a child. And though  never quite matched other cult favourites of the genre insofar as imagination and sheer creep-factor is concerned, that was then. In today's prestige TV landscape \u2014 where fantasy worlds are big on drama and special effects and everything but humour \u2014 the sweet and goofy tone of the Willowvese feels positively novel.&nbsp; The first two episodes debuted Nov. 30, and the action picks up a few hundred moons (to use the show's prescribed fantasy jargon) after Bavmorda's defeat. Her daughter Queen Sorsha is now on the throne (Joanne Whalley, reprising her role from the movie). And with forces of darkness once more threatening their world, a quest, of course, is in order. On the mission: Sorsha's battle-ready daughter Kit and her knight-in-training BFF. (All signs point&nbsp;to some future light romance there.) Other archetypes along for the journey: the soft-boi prince whom Kit's&nbsp;betrothed to marry; a sass-talking outlaw; Willow (natch); and a stowaway kitchen maid who's apparently a genius at baking muffins. Why her? The guy they're all out looking for is her one true love, Prince Airk. (He's kidnapped by toothy baddies that are as spooky as any nightmare-fuel from '80s fantasy cinema, but based on the first episode, this adventure will be heavier on the one-liners than self-serious medieval gore.) Sign me up for the campaign.  I have said it before, and it's a hill I will die on:&nbsp; is the best comic book-to-screen adaptation ever. In some ways that's a surprise, as the Doom Patrol are a distinctly C-list super hero team \u2014 indeed, their failure to measure up to the heights of their colleagues is a running in theme in both the show and the book \u2014 but in other ways, it's not surprising at all. The series is largely based on Grant Morrison's version of the team, and Morrison's late '80s/early '90s run on   was singularly brilliant. (If you haven't read it, you should stop reading this immediately and go read that instead.) In addition to the great source material, the cast absolutely smashes it. The show was a key part of Brendan Fraser's big comeback, even though he spends most of the show as a voice actor. Dianne Guerrero, who was  ,&nbsp;is an absolute star in this as Jane, who has 64 personalities, each one with a different superpower. The third season addition of   as sometimes ally, sometimes antagonist Madame Rouge was an excellent call. I am so stoked for Season 4 I am vibrating. If you know me personally, you know that I'm a bit obsessed with New Zealand. It feels like Canada, except more geographically compact and with its shit a bit more together. has been billed as \"New Zealand's first Jewish sitcom,\" and it's loosely based on the life of its&nbsp;star and creator (  writer Simone Nathan). Lulu (Nathan) is pushing 30 and under intense pressure to finally get married \u2014&nbsp;and marry Jewish. Unfortunately, Auckland's Jewish community is so small, everyone of an appropriate age feels more like a cousin that a possible mate. Also, she's in a \"shituationship\" with Ollie (Nathan's real-life husband Paul Williams), her affable, not-at-all Jewish, on-again-off-again not-quite-boyfriend. When she gets pregnant by Ollie, the whole situation comes to a head, presumably with hilarious and eventually heartwarming results.  Our girl Emily (Lily Collins), the millennial marketing VP who's captivated global audiences through her tenuous grasp of social media, is back for \"saison trois\" this month, and in the latest  , she declares she's facing the hardest decision of her  life. But whatever could it be?&nbsp; For those who've already pressed through Season 2, captivated by the  universe of crayon-box costuming, sneering French caricatures and a script that is almost certainly generated by an AI chatbot trying to sound like an 80-year-old drag queen, you'll remember we left things on a cliffhanger. Em's career and love life hang in the balance, though some of her choices seem easier to predict than others.  lacks the je ne sais quoi of the current title, so we can safely guess where she landed on the professional ultimatum: join up with her French boss Sylvie (Philippine Leroy-Beaulieu) in the (successful!) coup against Savoir, or boot it back to the States, where she's lined up a sweet promotion.&nbsp; As for romance, Alfie (Lucien Laviscount) is still in the picture. He's the British banker she took up with last season, and from the trailer's clips of Em  , maybe they're even hooking up in London when not floating over Provence in a pink and red hot-air balloon. But Gabriel \u2014 the (hot!) chef who lives downstairs from her overstuffed closet of berets \u2014 still has (hot!) feelings for her. Does it matter that he moved in with his ex within the last five minutes of Season 2? Mais non! This is Paris \u2014  . Love triangles are going to keep on triangulating, always with her at the centre \u2014 which means there's only thing that could prompt a moment of true existential angst on this show, and frankly, it's the reason I'll mainline all 10 episodes over the holiday break.&nbsp; She's talking about clothes, people. And will you get a load of the shoulder pads in the trailer? WHAT WILL SHE WEAR?!&nbsp; If you weren't among the lucky million or two people \u2014 we'll never quite know that number exactly,   \u2014&nbsp;that were able to see the second film in Rian Johnson's  universe during its brief run cinemas last month, you only have to wait a few weeks&nbsp;until you can watch it at home. Netflix will be streaming   as of Dec. 23, and&nbsp;I promise Daniel Craig's Benoit Blanc and the new cast of characters that join him have a true holiday gift in store. I've managed to see the film twice already, and am among the many that feels it somehow improves on its predecessor. I am also among the many who suggest you should go into it knowing as little as possible.  I was conflicted on whether or not I was going to include Season 11 of  in this list. (Yes, there have been 11 seasons of , with the caveat that each season is only six episodes, and they had two-per-calendar year until 2019.)&nbsp;To be honest, the last couple seasons were a little underwhelming. Then I re-watched  \u2014 the   spinoff that aired earlier this year, and turned a one-note peripheral character into a likable lead that had emotion and depth and pathos without sacrificing the deeply profane humour that audiences love \u2014 and remembered that when they're on, the   writing team are absolutely mindblowing comedic geniuses. I am of the opinion that   and   are two of the greatest episodes of half-hour scripted television comedy ever written anywhere. I have total faith that Season 11 will be an absolute banger and that, to borrow a quote from Shoresy, we will all like it the same way that \"your Mom just liked my Instagram post from two years ago in Puerto Vallarta.\""

    "body": "A 57-year-old engineer from Orange County, Calif., has been charged with murder in the gruesome slaying of a Canadian nurse almost three decades ago. Douglas Gordon Bradford is accused of strangling and fatally stabbing Lynne Knight, 28,&nbsp;on Aug. 29, 1979,&nbsp;in the community of Torrance, Calif. The pair had dated for several months in 1979 when she was a nurse at a Torrence hospital and he was an engineering student at California State Long Beach. At the time of her death, they were broken up. Knight was stabbed more than 15 times and strangled with a homemade garrote that was found near her body in her apartment. \"The investigation had gone for nearly 30 years,\" said Torrance police Sgt. Bernard Anderson on Thursday. \"In the late 1990s, we developed a cold case homicide team that was able to provide some leads, and those leads resulted in a filing with the DA's office, which occurred on Tuesday.\" Knight was born in Wetaskiwin, Alta., and grew up in Stratford, Ont. She&nbsp;was a graduate of Stratford Central Secondary School and St. Thomas-Elgin School of Nursing as well as finalist in the Red Rose nurse beauty contest. She had moved to California and worked as charge nurse of the neonatal intensive care unit at Little Company of Mary Hospital. She&nbsp;had become nurse recruiter at the hospital shortly before she was killed. Knight's father, Clair Knight, told&nbsp;the Daily Breeze, a Torrence newspaper, from his home in Sauble&nbsp;Beach, Ont., that the arrest is incredible. \"It's kind of a funny feeling,\" he said. \"You are happy to hear it, but it brings back all the sadness.\" His daughter had told her family that her boyfriend had a bad temper, slammed doors and screeched his car tires as he sped away following arguments with her, Knight said. Bradford is free on $1-million US bail and will be back in court for his arraignment on June 18. If convicted, he&nbsp;faces 26 years to life in prison."

Netflix added a disclaimer to the YouTube trailer \"to inform viewers that the show is fictional,\" according to the report.            The trailer hints at the events Season 5 explores, including the unravelling of the marriage of Charles and Diana.&nbsp; \"Tawdry tabloid headlines laid bare the many cracks in their marriage for years,\" noted the CBC newsletter   in an examination of the new season. Here are five true events in the lives of the Royal Family in the 1990s as CBC saw them. 1. Charles and Diana's 10th wedding anniversary In 1991, the CBC current affairs program Midday observed Charles and Diana's 10-year wedding anniversary with guest Ingrid Seward, editor of Majesty Magazine. \"What is the latest on the marriage?\" asked host Nancy Wilson. \"Well, there's all kinds of innuendo and gossip and rumours. I mean, each day we have new stories,\" said Seward, who was speaking remotely from London. \"But I think most of them are unfounded. The trouble is nobody really knows the true state of the marriage.\" 2. A devastating fire The opening frames of the   depict the stone walls of Windsor Castle silhouetted by raging orange flames \u2014 a disaster that took place on Nov. 20, 1992. According to the Royal Trust Collection website, the fire started in Queen Victoria's Private Chapel, where a faulty spotlight ignited a curtain next to the altar. CBC cameras captured the charred remains of the castle on Nov. 22, 1992, after the flames were extinguished.&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. The apparent end of the 'fairy-tale romance' The fire happened around the same time as the release of the paperback edition of Diana: Her True Story, a biography by Andrew Morton. On CBC's The National, reporter Gillian Findlay spoke to Morton about the book's new chapter, which she said concluded that \"the fairy-tale romance [was] dead.\" \"I would have loved to have written a chapter that said they've reconciled their differences, the book has brought them together, that their friends have been united in trying to make this marriage work,\" he said. \"It didn't happen.\"&nbsp; 4. Separate households In December 1992 Charles and Diana separated. CBC's Midday spoke to CBC reporter Ann MacMillan in London about what impact, if any, the decision might have for the monarchy.&nbsp; \"The one thing that the Buckingham Palace statement made clear was there is no talk of official divorce so in fact they will be still married but they'll be living in separate households,\" said MacMillan.&nbsp; 5. Divorce directive from the Queen In December 1995, CBC anchor Peter Mansbridge said on The National that Charles and Diana were headed for \"the world's most famous divorce\" under the direction of Queen Elizabeth. Just before Christmas, the Queen \"put her royal foot down\" and effectively told the pair to \"end it all \u2014 end the public bickering, the humiliation, the gossip and the guessing,\" said reporter Paul Workman.&nbsp; \"Unless she asserts her authority, this bickering will go on in public indefinitely,\" said constitutional expert Lord St. John of Fawsley. \"She has decided that a divorce really would be the lesser of two evils and she wants to bring this whole painful episode to an end.\" The Crown debuts Nov. 9 on Netflix. &nbsp;"

    "body": "Since the closing of New Brunswick's borders in March, the province has moved dozens of employees&nbsp;to work at border checkpoints, screening travellers for COVID-19.&nbsp; The large-scale operation at all points of entry shows no signs of scaling down, even with the opening of New Brunswick to Atlantic Canadian travellers. On day six of the Atlantic bubble, about a dozen peace officers screened drivers entering from Nova Scotia at the Aulac crossing, near Amherst, N.S.&nbsp;Vehicles were sorted into lanes, and&nbsp;officers walked up to car windows, clipboards in hand, to ask a list of questions.&nbsp; The oncoming line of traffic, a mix of commercial trucks and passenger vehicles, snaked around the bend in the highway and out of sight several kilometres away. It moved steadily toward the checkpoint, as officers tried to screen each vehicle as quickly as possible. The staff at these screening areas work around the clock, and are a diverse group of provincial employees:&nbsp;forest rangers, commercial vehicle enforcement officers, corrections officers and others who are considered peace officers.&nbsp; They have taken on a new role, working 12-hour shifts at the province's boundaries, and are now responsible for&nbsp;exercising discretion in determining if a traveller meets the criteria to enter.&nbsp; It's a move some law enforcement and border experts are following closely. Kelly Sundberg, an associate professor in the department of economics, justice and policy studies at Mount Royal University, said the pandemic has resulted in unprecedented changes to travel within the country.&nbsp; \"I cannot see another example in Canadian history where we've had peace officers controlling our inter-provincial borders,\" he said.&nbsp; Peace officers are defined under the Criminal Code of Canada as people acting in a law enforcement capacity. The province has used forest rangers, conservation officers, commercial vehicle enforcement officers, off road vehicle enforcement officers, national safety code investigators, general investigative service members, corrections officers and sheriff officers. Border checkpoints have been used by other provinces earlier in the pandemic to control certain regions \u2014 but not to the extent of the Maritimes.&nbsp; The Quebec government set up screening points to stop non-essential travel in the national capital region between Ottawa and Gatineau, Que. Those operations were run by Gatineau's municipal police before the provincial government removed the checkpoints&nbsp;in May. Many provinces established checkpoints staffed by public health officials to provide information on COVID-19 safety measures. Those were largely informational and not designed to control interprovincial travel. Under the state of emergency, the province has a law enforcement coordination group which oversees the use of peace officers. It is led by the commanding officer of the RCMP's division for New Brunswick.&nbsp; Peace officers at the borders are not subject to an independent public review in the event of a complaint. Instead, the Department of Public Safety says it has an internal system in place for investigations. Sundberg, who studies borders and policing, said the lack of an external process is understandable, given the state of emergency. But it could be problematic amid the current climate and concerns around law enforcement, especially if the checkpoints remain for a long period of time. \"There's a public expectation it will be independent or outside,\" he said.&nbsp; The dozens of staff involved are sometimes moved to different locations, and different shifts, working during the day or at night, switching off at 7 a.m. and 7 p.m. They run screening operations at 11 points of entry to New Brunswick, including three airports and the ferry terminal in Saint John. The peace officers are rotated in and out&nbsp;to give them time to continue working in their regular positions if needed. The Department of Public Safety has on average four to eight peace officers at checkpoints, supplemented by administrative screeners. Those numbers can be higher during periods of heavy traffic to maintain flow. In a 24 hour period, the province has an average of 40 peace officers with 25 screeners working at the borders.&nbsp; The RCMP has also been assisting with screening at multiple locations since border restrictions began in March.&nbsp; John Lunney is the acting deputy chief for the Department of Public Safety's inspection enforcement branch. He is a peace officer and said other officers within various New Brunswick departments were given the opportunity to help. \"I'm sure some peace officers probably find it a challenge based on what it is they're faced with,\" Lunney said. \"But our staff are professional, we give them good training and I think they conduct themselves professionally each and every time.\" Lunney said finding staff on an&nbsp;ongoing basis has been a challenge. \"The people of New Brunswick and the people of Atlantic Canada and the United States have all been primarily gracious and understanding because they want their health protected as well,\" he said. \"But there's been the odd challenge with the odd difficult personality.\" Since the Atlantic travel bubble opened on July 3, some officers have been forced to adapt to screening thousands of vehicles per day. When traffic backed up for kilometres on the first day at the New Brunswick-Nova Scotia border, vehicles were waved through to speed up the process.&nbsp;Since then, a second lane has been added for commuters and commercial vehicles. Those heading to Prince Edward Island are no longer screened and instead directed to the highway exit for&nbsp;the Confederation Bridge. Daily commuters crossing for work are provided with a pass to allow for quicker travel between provinces.&nbsp; Public safety officials are also constructing a paved area in the median to make space for trailers,&nbsp;clearing more space on the highway. The officers ask travellers if they have left the Atlantic region in the past 14 days and if they have any symptoms of COVID-19. If they need to self-isolate, a peace officer will explain the rules and requirements.&nbsp; Lunney said training has been provided to employees on effective screening and the types of questions to ask travellers. They also receive safety training on best practices and personal protection equipment.&nbsp; Steven Schneider, a criminology professor at Saint Mary's University, said police have stopped vehicles between provinces in instances of violence, such as mass killings. Peace officers have been tasked to do other jobs during times of emergencies, such as forest fires, flooding and other natural disasters. Shortly after 9/11 there were some peace officers and police officers deployed to do specialized work.  the current use of peace officers is unique. Schneider is concerned provincial border restrictions will continue for a longer period of time. \"There should be free movement between provinces without any kind of checkpoints or concerns that people are going to be stopped by police.\" Sundberg&nbsp;said beyond environment officers checking&nbsp;boats for invasive plants, there really isn't another example of any kind of provincial checkpoint that would occur with regularity.&nbsp;    It just shows the extraordinary nature of this pandemic and the controls that some jurisdictions are taking.      Sundberg has worked in customs and immigration and helped create the Canada Border Services Agency. He studies border policy and has been following New Brunswick's use of checkpoints closely. He said the geography of New Brunswick and other Atlantic provinces allows for travel restrictions with checkpoints, unlike large western provinces where boundaries are too long to effectively control. \"It just shows the extraordinary nature of this pandemic and the controls that some jurisdictions are taking,\" he said.&nbsp;&nbsp; \"It's never been done before, so it's definitely something that's going to cause questions among some.\" Peace officers from various law enforcement backgrounds all receive general training. While they are all armed at the provincial borders, most would typically also have a firearm in their usual job. \"I'm sure it's very different for those crossing the border, trying to cross the border into New Brunswick, it would be very unique and perhaps unsettling for some,\" Sundberg said. \"But I think at the end of the day, the province decided what it needed to do and is doing this with the best intentions, I'm sure.\""

    "body": "Karly Church, 31, escaped the dangerous world of domestic sex trafficking when a police officer found her in a hotel room, and her two traffickers were arrested. Six years later, Church now works as a crisis intervention counsellor with Victim Services of Durham Region, east of Toronto. She also teams up with Durham Regional Police detectives in the field to help underage girls and young women caught up in the heinous crime. \"I want to instill hope,\" Church says. \"I want them to see that there is a way out, and there is the ability that they can reach any goal that they have for themselves. That you don't have to be stuck, that there are people who care.\" Human trafficking is a fast-growing crime in Canada and one of the most difficult to beat. According to  , reports of the \"most serious violation\" of laws around human trafficking soared from a couple of dozen across the country in 2010 to 340 in 2016. StatsCan adds that, \"human trafficking is difficult to measure, due in part to its hidden nature. While there has been an increase in the number of human trafficking incidents reported by police in recent years, human trafficking remains highly underreported.\" The majority of reported cases are in Ontario, and 93 per cent of the victims are female. Approximately 72 per cent of female trafficking victims are under the age of 25, and can be as young as 12 years old. And the conditions police find victims in can be horrific. \"There are incidents with girls getting waterboarded, eating their own feces, being brutally raped,\" says Detective Dave Davies, who runs the Durham Regional Police Human Trafficking Unit. \"The hardest ones are the ones that are young \u2014&nbsp;the young ones that have never had sex before and they lose their virginity to some John, or they end up getting pregnant. Those are real scenarios that we've dealt with.\" The Durham Regional Police are one of the first in Canada to work directly with a human trafficking survivor, and they say Church is their secret weapon. With six detectives attached to the Human Trafficking Unit, most of them undercover, the police have nicknamed her Number Seven. \"She's a part of our team,\" says Detective Davies. The collaboration between the Durham Regional Police Unit and Victims Services of Durham Region is about building relationships and trust with the victims. Church and Davies say it's working. Since Church got involved, the number of local police investigations has doubled and so has the number of victims she is supporting. In 2018, Victim Services of Durham Region helped 120 human trafficking victims, and in 2019 that jumped to 240. Building trust On a recent afternoon, Church and the detectives combed through online sex ads looking for clues leading to underage girls. On any given day there can be anywhere from 30 to 100 new ads posted just in their region. \"You can see 22, 19, 22, they're all different ages. We're looking for younger looking females right now,\" Detective Davies says. \"They can kind of give us clues to where they are. So, like, Westney Road, 401, Ajax, Whitby, Oshawa. When it says 'back in town,' that means they were somewhere else,\" he adds, a potential sign that they're being trafficked. \"Karly helps out and gives her opinion. We work together and try and find somebody, and go talk to them.\" Undercover detectives set up fake \"dates\" to try and meet up with the women at nearby hotels to make sure they aren't underage, and also that they aren't being forced into sex. Often Church joins the offsite operations. Having identified an ad that concerns the team, they all head out the door of police headquarters and meet at a nearby hotel, where the first date has been set up for the day. These hotel operations can be dangerous. Often, the pimps are nearby in adjoining rooms or even in the room's own bathroom, and sometimes they're armed. After the detectives establish the room number, they enter and make sure the person and the situation is safe. Church and Davies stay back until they get they get the okay to come in. Church then works to build trust with the women. \"I think immediately if somebody comes to your door and identifies as police, it's intimidating,\" Church says. \"Just because a lot of times it's like, 'what's&nbsp; going to happen to me?' And there's a bit of a panic.\" This time the woman in the room has been told about Church and wants to talk to her. Most of them do. The woman isn't underage, but she takes Church's contact information. The police meet at a nearby parking lot for a debrief. Church is happy with the outcome: Community outreach Durham Region has a trafficking coalition consisting of community workers and organizations. They're trying to raise awareness to help discourage the crime, and they also help victims find the support they may need for addiction, housing, a bus pass and even food. Raising awareness includes school outreach and education. Church does public service announcements to spread the word about things such as signs to look for that may indicate someone is being trafficked. She also speaks to Grade 8 and 9 students. \"My name's Karly, I'm actually a survivor of domestic sex trafficking. I had a pimp and he forced me to work in the sex trade,\" Church tells a group of students. Karly was lured in by human traffickers at a time when she had nowhere to go. She'd left home, then been kicked out of a detox centre. Another girl who'd also left the detox centre persuaded Karly to go with her to a house, where she met the traffickers who drew her into the sex trade. As the kids listen, she presents the facts on how it happened to her. She describes how traffickers prey on the most vulnerable, and can often disguise themselves as a boyfriend or someone who can be trusted. \"He is looking for someone who maybe is being bullied in school. He's looking for someone who maybe doesn't have that brand-name clothing or brand new iPhone,\" says Church. Karly's presentation leaves the room silent. What is most concerning is how many kids approach Church after her captivating presentations. \"In my experience, after every presentation I have ever done, someone has come up after and made a disclosure \u2014&nbsp;either 'this happened to me,' or 'I think this is happening to me,' or 'I know someone this is happening to.' That's in 36 schools,\" says Church. Kayla Yama is a clinical director of Victim Services for Durham Region, and coordinates the public presentations with Church. She says public outreach helps reduce the stigma, encouraging people to speak up if they or someone they know is a target of sex trafficking. Yama says there has been a \"huge shift in terms of awareness\" locally. She adds that it's due largely to people \"coming forward to Victim Services of Durham Region, coming forward to the community, coming forward to their parents \u2014&nbsp;the bravery that it takes, it astounds me every day \u2014&nbsp;and saying that this happened to me. It allows people not to overlook it and say this is something that couldn't happen to my child.\" Back at police headquarters, Detective Davies says the program is a success, but his team wants to do more. He's hopeful that in the near future the force can make that happen with some provincial funding. \"It would help for sure. \"We have six detectives here. We have one Karly,\" he says, adding that he'd like a \"Number Eight\" to join the team&nbsp;to help with Church's growing workload."

But the kids they were watching on screen were undaunted by meeting the Marvel Comics legend more than&nbsp;four decades ago. And they had a lot of good questions for him. \"How do you think of the characters like Spider-Man?\" a boy asked Lee, when he appeared on CBC's  , back in 1978. The answer might have surprised fans of the prolific comic-book writer and editor. \"With great difficulty,\" Lee replied. \"But, I really don't know how.\" Taking stock of the Marvel universe He went on to explain that it normally involved looking at who was already a resident of the Marvel Comics universe. \"If we need a new character, I'll sit down and I'll say: 'Well, we need a new character,\" Lee explained. \"Now, let's see:&nbsp;we already have a guy who crawls on walls and spins webs, we already have a guy who's the god of thunder and a fellow who's got green skin and he breaks buildings up and so forth. What haven't we got?\" The next step was to think of who that next character to join the Marvel universe might be. \"Then you sort of sit and eliminate. You say: 'Well, we don't have a fellow, perhaps, who can counteract the power of gravity. Maybe a person who can walk on air and we'll call him 'Anti-Gravity Man,'\" said Lee, giving an example of how he would select such a character. \"Or maybe a fellow who can walk through walls, you know, and we'll call him the Wall Walker.\" 'Getting the idea is easy' The work didn't end there, though. \"Getting the idea is easy,\" Lee said, noting the tough part was figuring out \"what can I do to this character to make the readers care about him?\" Another child asked Lee how he kept his stories interesting as they went along.&nbsp;The Marvel man said it came down to ensuring there were enough twists and turns for readers to enjoy. Above all, the characters needed to make readers want to root for them, Lee explained. \"It doesn't matter if the character is ugly, or is handsome, or is weak, or is strong,\" he said, noting what was most important was for there to be \"something about the character that makes you like the character and care about the character.\" Lee, who&nbsp; &nbsp;in 2018, made several appearances on CBC-TV in the 1970s. He was interviewed on the late-night talk show&nbsp;  on two occasions and he also appeared as  ."

    "body": "As the Democratic Republic of the Congo continues fighting the second largest Ebola virus outbreak in history, University of Manitoba researchers will travel&nbsp;to West Africa to help prevent survivors from sexually transmitting the disease. Jason Kindrachuk, an associate professor from the U of M who is part of the team, said half of all male Ebola survivors who pass a blood test for the virus&nbsp;will unknowingly carry it in their reproductive systems for anywhere from four months to three years. That means despite the practice of placing those with Ebola in quarantine during outbreaks, a patient who is cleared can transmit the disease through sexual intercourse, not knowing the virus is still present in his reproductive tract. \"What we know about the Ebola virus is that it decimates most major organs it infects,\" Kindrachuk&nbsp;said. \"But it doesn't seem to do that in the reproductive system in males. It stays and persists for a long period of time.\" Kindrachuk and two PhD candidates from the U of M will travel&nbsp;to Sierra Leone&nbsp;to interview Ebola survivors about any long-term sexual health complexities they've experienced, such as changes in hormone levels and libido, and the ability to conceive. The West African country is 4,000 kilometres away from the current outbreak but was part of a previous outbreak. Before going to Africa, the team is starting to analyze how and why Ebola gets into the reproductive system&nbsp;and the effects it has on the system. \"Ultimately, what our work is going to be able to do is help guide outbreak containment strategies.\" Little knowledge about Ebola \"We still really don't understand how this virus does what it does to humans,\" Kindrachuk said. \"Nor do we truly know where it comes from in nature.\" Ebola virus first appeared in Africa in 1976, the World Health Organization says. It is a rare but severe illness that destroys the human body from the inside. On average, people who contract the virus have a 50/50 chance of surviving. Researchers believe the virus is transmitted to people from wild animals, and carried mainly by bats. Researchers believe the animal can carry the virus without getting sick, Kindrachuk said. Bats may be able to transmit the virus by biting a human, or biting an animal that is later consumed by somebody, he said. It's also common for people in Africa&nbsp;to eat bats, so if Ebola is alive in the animal during consumption, that is another way the disease can be transmitted. \"There is, realistically, any number of mechanisms how humans can get infected,\" Kindrachuk said. \"It's really difficult for us to figure out how to stop this virus in its tracks before it starts to spread.\" Once contracted, the virus spreads through human-to-human contact with bodily fluids, such as blood or feces, of someone who has or died from Ebola. The illness also can spread if someone touches an object contaminated with the bodily fluids of someone infected with Ebola. That's why it's not uncommon for health-care workers to get infected during an outbreak. Now that researchers know survivors also can transmit the virus, there is much more to learn, Kindrachuk said. Ebola and the reproductive system Kindrachuk and his team are trying to find out how and why the virus gets into the reproductive system, and why it stays there for so long. \"These are big unanswered questions for us, if you ever want to be able to circumvent outbreaks within these regions of the world,\" he said. Although the data is still being pieced together, there is evidence suggesting Ebola can impact long-term semen health, he said. University&nbsp;of Manitoba&nbsp;PhD candidate Andrew Webb, another member of the team, is studying how tissues of the immune system protect those of the reproductive system. He's using tissue samples from mice, but Kindrachuk said the team is waiting for approval to gain access to human samples. Webb told CBC News that, from what he has seen so far, is that the Ebola virus interacts with testicular cells differently than the rest of the body. \"The cells do get infected, but somehow they're managing to sort of limit the replication of the virus in the cells,\" he said. \"Basically, the cells are acting as a sort of reservoir where the virus persists, and it is alive and replicating, but at a much slower pace. That's allowing the cells to handle the virus instead of reacting heavily to it, and causing a chain reaction that leads to cell death.&nbsp; \"The testicular cells\u2026 are hosting the virus, limiting the growth, without necessarily killing it off.\" Kindrachuk said the team will soon use mice to see how often they can transmit Ebola through intercourse, and how it gets into a male mouse's testicles. Female reproductive system There have been a few cases where a woman sexually transmitted Ebola to a man, but when it comes to how Ebola affects the female reproductive system, there are very few leads, Kindrachuk said. He said the data's gender bias could be due to a general lack of testing on women, or because women are reluctant to be studied. From what little data is available, Kindrachuk said the virus appears to linger in women less often than in men. He hypothesizes that this is due to the vast differences between the male and female reproductive tracts, and it's possible \"the female reproductive tract has a strong enough defence system to help reduce the amount of virus that the reproductive tissue receives.\" What Kindrachuk called \"the million-dollar question\" that desperately needs to be answered&nbsp;is whether Ebola can be passed on genetically. Kids infected by Ebola have a high fatality rate, so researchers believe they may be more susceptible to the virus, but there's no hard evidence supporting that theory. Women with the virus who become pregnant often get abortions,&nbsp;Kindrachuk&nbsp;said, but the babies who have been born have shown no signs of being infected. When to expect published findings \"In about two to five years, we'll be able to put together quite a few stories, and have a pretty good blueprint in terms of what is going on with Ebola virus persistence,\" Kindrachuk said. The research currently underway will allow findings to be published sooner once touching down in Sierra Leone, but the process of studying samples and survivors will slow down once the team's in Africa, he said. \"There are some obstacles in terms of equipment, and a little bit in terms of facilities,\" Kindrachuk said. Webb, the PhD candidate, said the stigma associated with Ebola also could slow&nbsp;the research in Sierra Leone. \"There are a lot of ethical issues surrounding taking samples,\" Webb said. \"We're going to have enough trouble as it is getting Ebola virus survivors to provide survey feedback. \"It will depend on whether or not we can convince them of our positive benefits, of whether or not we'll allow them to have a better life.\" Until answers are found, survivors are being told to use condoms during sex&nbsp;or to be abstinent, Kindrachuk said. The outbreak in Congo started just over a year ago; there have been 3,228 total cases and 2,153 people have died,   from the World Health Organization says. Last week, the WHO said the number of  . Its latest risk assessment said there are 15 new cases per week, which is significantly down from 128 per week at the outbreak's peak. Kindrachuk was a health-care worker&nbsp;in Sierra Leone while West Africa suffered the largest Ebola outbreak in history. The outbreak spanned from 2014 to 2016, and according to  , there were over 25,000 total cases, and more than 11,000 people died."

    "body": "NAME: Jenny Laviolette  OCCUPATION: Cheerleading Coach/Communications Advisor  AGE: 29  HOMETOWN: Ottawa, Ont. Born into a Lebanese family and the fourth youngest of five children, Jenny is no stranger to fighting for what she wants. She's now a professional cheerleading coach and knows exactly how to motivate a team.&nbsp; What's driving you to take on Canada's Ultimate Challenge? This is the first time that I am doing something big for myself. No one asked me to participate in  and I am not doing it for any reason other than to show myself that I can make myself proud.&nbsp; I have never been one to get excited about the unknown. It's always made me nervous and anxious. I have never felt the thrill of taking part in something unexpected, until now. What unique skills will set you apart from the competition? I may not be the most athletic, strongest or fastest player but I am a force when it comes to understanding, executing and accomplishing a task.&nbsp; My mind is my strongest muscle and I am a firm leader who can play on the strengths of her team. I have the never-ending energy to uplift people and help them realize how much they can accomplish. What are some real-life obstacles you've had to overcome? In the last few years, I have experienced a lot of life changes. In 2020, my decade-long relationship with the person I thought was going to be my life partner ended. In 2023, I retired from the Ottawa Redblacks cheerleading and dance team after 10 seasons.&nbsp; I had to discover who I was outside of those 10-year relationships. The last years have been spent redefining who I am and who I want to be. It's been emotional, it's been hard, but mostly it's been rewarding.&nbsp; Participating in this challenge is what I need to take another step out of my comfort zone and a leap closer to discovering who I am at my core. If you were going to compete in the Olympics which sport would you pick and why? I would choose artistic gymnastics. Why? 1) Have you seen how strong those athletes are? 2) Have you seen how cute the outfits are? 3) I get to incorporate some of my daily dance party moves into the incredible choreography!&nbsp; What's a random fact that people would be shocked to learn about you? I love musical theatre and Broadway! My workout playlist shuffle varies from heavy rap to Broadway, to oldies, to R&amp;B, back to Broadway, to punk to slow sad girl jams, and then probably back to Broadway!  &nbsp;"

Marketplace is back \u2014 launching our milestone 50th season We are celebrating a rare achievement in Canadian television \u2014 it's our 50th season! We've spent months combing through decades of episodes to bring you some of our most incredible moments in a one-hour special presentation.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  From the theme song, performed in-studio by Canadian icon Stompin' Tom Connors, to our more recent shows examining forced labour in Canada's food and clothing supply lines. Of course, we've been busting scammers, calling out big corporations and governments along the way.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  But the treat for us was interviewing our very first host, Joan Watson. She's 90 now, and remembers the threats&nbsp;the show would&nbsp;get from groups who didn't want the scrutiny. She's a gem who helps our whole team connect what we do now with the origins of  . It comes down to having your back, a phrase we've used as a tagline for many of our episodes.  &nbsp;  If you think about all the twists and turns of a regular Marketplace episode, imagine packing all the highlights into a power-hour of television. Tune into  's 50th Anniversary Special Friday, Oct. 7, at 8 p.m. (8:30 NT) on CBC TV, or on&nbsp; Marketplace special comes at a time when consumer protection is under threat, experts say While putting together our 50th anniversary special, we screened hours and hours of  content dating back to 1972, when the show premiered. \"It struck me how accessible politicians were, back in the day. You see Joan [Watson] interviewing the federal minister of consumer affairs \u2014 that kind of access is extremely rare today,\" says  host David Common. Instead, says Common, requests for interviews often turn into lengthy exchanges with \"handlers\" who might take weeks or longer to eventually decline the request, or only agree to answer questions in writing. \"There's been a steady decline in consumer protection over the past few decades,\" says John Lawford, executive director of the Public Interest Advocacy Centre (PIAC), a non-profit that acts on behalf of consumers. Lawford says politicians and corporations don't feel obligated to answer questions in part because Canadians aren't demanding they do. \"There hasn't been a 10,000-person march on Parliament Hill to complain about cellphone fees, so no one in government feels compelled to do anything about that,\" he says.&nbsp; Paying with credit card? Expect to see a new fee when you shop A new rule came into effect Thursday allowing retailers and other businesses to charge customers a fee of up to 2.4 per cent&nbsp;on purchases made with credit cards. The change is the result of a long-running lawsuit on the issue in Canada. In the past, stores had to give a percentage of every sale to credit card providers for making a transaction happen. As part of an original agreement, this charge could not be passed on to customers. The fee can range from fractions of a percentage point, to more than two per cent of the purchase price on some premium cards. But as part of a settlement, Visa, MasterCard, and other card providers agreed to rebate merchants $188 million for what are known as interchange fees that merchants were charged in the past decade. Starting Thursday, merchants must give card providers 30 days' notice of their intent to start charging a fee. They must also make it clear to customers at the time of payment that there's a surcharge, and it can't be more than they pay themselves.&nbsp; Finally, the surcharge will be capped at 2.4 per cent. But the rules won't be in force in Quebec, because that type of fee is forbidden under the province's Consumer Protection Act.&nbsp; Can't find kids' fever reducing meds? Here are&nbsp;some tips on what to do Many of us are feeling supply chain woes as cold and flu season ramps up, and parents are flooding social media sites in search of fever-reducing medication for their young ones. Pediatricians and pharmacists are urging parents not to panic: There are options. \"I think that we need to always remember that the vast, vast majority of fevers in young immunized children who were previously healthy are caused by viruses, and they'll go away on their own,\" said Dr. Sarah Reid, who works at the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario.&nbsp; Reid said it's important for parents to know that fever is a sign that the immune system is working. What's more important than the reading on the thermometer, she said, is how the child looks and interacts when the fever is treated. Mina Tadrous, an assistant professor at the Leslie Dan faculty of pharmacy at the University of Toronto, says to talk to your pharmacist about other options for medications. \"As a backup, if you aren't able to get the formulations that are available out there, there are ways for pharmacists to compound solutions,\" Tadrous said, adding that many but not all pharmacists offer a compounding service. Longer term, supply chains will catch up and there's no need to stockpile medications at home because it can contribute to the hysteria, Tadrous said.&nbsp; What else is going on?  Charging ports for handheld devices will all have to be USB-C. Sorry Apple!

    "body": "The Greater Vancouver Zoo is planning a multi-million dollar revamp of the park and many of its attractions, amid&nbsp;ongoing concern for the welfare of its animals. General manager Serge Lussier&nbsp;says the zoo plans to move away&nbsp;from small enclosures, and will convert&nbsp;half its space into a safari-style park for animals from across the world.&nbsp; \"I want this to be a piece of Africa in the heart of B.C.,\" Lussier told CBC News, pointing toward the area of his proposed savannah at the facility in Langley, B.C.&nbsp;\"I'm going to open this up, to have all the land open for African animals.\" Lussier says he also wants to renovate several of the remaining enclosures and boost \"enrichment\" to keep animals from getting bored. He said the plan will cost $10-20 million over the next four or five years. \"We will be among the best in the world,\" said Lussier, who has around four decades of experience in the industry. Concerns over lack of space The proposed redevelopment follows years of criticism from advocates over&nbsp;conditions animals are kept in at the facility. Last year, the wildlife protection non-profit Zoocheck released a report calling on the zoo to make several improvements, suggesting small enclosures and a lack of stimulation could be taking a physical and psychological toll on several species, including raptors, reptiles, amphibians, hippos and giraffes.  dating as far back as 1997, saying \"the GVZ seems to have made a number of significant, very positive changes\u2026 however, some long standing issues remain problematic and should be addressed.\" The Vancouver Humane Society, which&nbsp;commissioned the report, said it has attempted to speak with Lussier on several occasions, but has&nbsp;yet to receive a response. The society voiced caution over Lussier's plans.&nbsp; \"We need to see exactly what the plan is and see how it's going to be rolled out,\" said spokesperson Peter Fricker. \"Our concern would be that too much investment might be just to enhance the visitor experience, rather than improve conditions for the animals.\" Fricker says the society has encouraged the zoo to transition into&nbsp;a sanctuary for native species, and there are concerns about the general manager's proposed savannah exhibit. \"People need to remember the savannah is a very hot, dry place and B.C. is not a hot, dry place for most of the year,\" he said. Breeding debate The issue of breeding also remains contentious. The Vancouver Humane Society recommends that the zoo's current roster of exotic animals live out their days and the zoo not replace or breed them. Lussier, though, says breeding isn't off the table \u2014&nbsp;particularly for endangered species at the facility, like the Siberian tiger. He says the zoo has applied to the U.S.-based Association of Zoos and Aquariums, which accredits facilities for animal care and welfare, to bring in more of the big cats in hopes of breeding them in future. Conflict of interest concern Lussier also serves as head of Canada's Accredited Zoos and Aquariums (CAZA) \u2014&nbsp;a non-profit that spearheads zoo and aquarium accreditation on this side of the border. That's created some concern over a potential conflict of interest over accrediting the zoo. Fricker says CAZA is primarily a trade association for zoos. \"It would be better if an independent body were looking at the standards of the zoo and granting it permits on that basis,\" he said. But Lussier insists there's no conflict of interest, as the zoo is already accredited. \"We're good for five years \u2014&nbsp;sometimes there's an interim inspection ... after three years or sometimes after one year,\" he said. \"If there are&nbsp;any issues I'll be part of the team that will be discussing issues and working toward solutions but I will not \u2014&nbsp;I cannot \u2014&nbsp;be inspecting my own zoo.\""

    "body": "           Vo Van Dung gave the television cameras a thumbs-up as he walked through Toronto's Pearson International Airport.&nbsp; Along with more than 100 Vietnamese boat people&nbsp;who arrived in Canada between 2014 and 2017, he was landing in the country after seemingly living in the shadows of society for the previous 20 years. Rather than live under Communist rule in Vietnam, many who fled their homeland after the Vietnam War sought refuge in neighbouring Thailand in the 1970s and '80s. But refuge came with a price. For decades, they were living \"without status\" or as \"stateless\" people. They could not work without the threat of being arrested or fined. They had no access to health care. Some relied on donations to make ends meet. They had few to no options until Canada accepted them under a special program designed to resettle boat people who had been living under desperate circumstances. But CBC News has learned that Vo was apparently living a more privileged life prior to coming to Canada. The 57-year-old had been running a tour guide business. Headquartered in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, Saigon Red Travel Company Limited offered tours between Vietnam and Thailand. And Vo wasn't shy about his business and travel ventures, posing for photos with employees that were posted to social media. A&nbsp;CBC&nbsp;investigation into the program has found at least five people, including Vo, ended up in Canada even though they do not appear to be those the government wanted to help, raising questions about the checks and balances meant to protect the country's&nbsp;immigration&nbsp;system.&nbsp; \"Canada is known for being an international example for humanitarian endeavours, for people who are displaced, for people who are in trouble somehow,\" said Guidy Mamann, a refugee lawyer in Toronto. \"If people took the place of a more deserving candidate, then that would trouble me a lot.\" Vo did not respond to CBC's requests for comment. But when CBC News asked an acquaintance of his about his business and lifestyle, he said Vo goes back and forth between Vietnam, Thailand and greater Vancouver and \"thinks he's doing very well.\"&nbsp; Who are the stateless? A humanitarian crisis ensued following the fall of Saigon in 1975. Close to one million people fled from Vietnam \u2014 many by boat. Their journeys were perilous. The United Nations estimates up to 250,000 boat people died at sea. Many of the boat people who did make it landed in neighbouring countries such as Malaysia, Hong Kong, the Philippines and Thailand. Canada alone took in more than 100,000 refugees after the war. In 1996, Vietnam repatriated tens of thousands of boat people from abroad. Those who did not want to go back because of fear of persecution back home escaped from refugee camps, living stateless in places like Thailand. In 2006, the Vietnamese Canadian Federation (VCF), along with a U.S.-based group called the Vietnamese Overseas Initiative for Conscience Empowerment (VOICE), appealed to the Canadian government to bring over a number of stranded people from Thailand. Current Alberta Premier Jason Kenney, who was federal immigration minister at the time, met discreetly with Thai government officials to ensure they would be provided exit permits to leave the country.&nbsp; A Canadian government official says Thai officials did not want to raise awareness about the program for fear that thousands of people would enter the country illegally and turn their country into an immigration hub. \"I actually went to Bangkok \u2026 and we had a lot of negotiations,\" Kenney told a room full of recently arrived stranded people in Vancouver, according to a YouTube video of the 2014 session. \"We promised to do this negotiation in a discreet way.\" According to a senior government official and another person consulted in developing the resettlement program, the conditions for the more than 100 people who were eventually let in were narrow and specific: those who were selected had to have remained in Thailand after leaving Vietnam between 1984 and 1991. This meant anyone who had been repatriated back to Vietnam or lived elsewhere would not qualify.            But Mamann, the Toronto immigration lawyer, said there were major shortcomings in program's written policy, which was called a \"Memorandum Of Understanding Relating To A Temporary Public Policy Concerning Certain Vietnamese Persons In Thailand.\" The MOU said that applicants had to have arrived from Vietnam between 1984 and 1991&nbsp;and be residing in Thailand \u2014 but it never specifically said that they had to have lived continuously in Thailand the entire time. \"This is an obvious error\u2026. The whole underpinning of this thing was we believe that you can't go back to your country [and] that you're stuck here. You're like on an island in the middle of the ocean and we have to come and rescue you,\" said Mamann. \"The language was sloppy and not precise.\" The first wave of people arrived in Canada in 2014, with the last family arriving in 2017.&nbsp; But towards the end of the program, the Vietnamese community in North America and overseas began criticizing some of those who were chosen for it. 'Please help us' Nguyen Tu, a former boat person who runs a cyber security company in Houston, began investigating the concerns in 2016 after receiving tips about the program from people stranded in Thailand. He travelled to Vietnam and Thailand and heard allegations that a number of vulnerable people who believe they should have been accepted into the program had been overlooked. \"Several boat people from Thailand contacted me \u2026 [saying]: 'Please help us, help us,' \" said Nguyen.&nbsp; The claims and the numbers of incidents prompted him to arrange meetings with officials from the Thailand Immigration Bureau, the Canada Border Services Agency and the RCMP in Thailand. He said he provided them with material he had uncovered.&nbsp; Then in May 2019, Father Nguyen Thien, a U.S.-based priest, along with Dau Vu Bac, a former boat person living in the U.S., hosted a Facebook video live from Bangkok&nbsp;in a room of stateless Vietnamese making more allegations.&nbsp; The video, viewed close 50,000 times, accused groups such as VOICE of selecting people such as Vo Van Dung, who had gone back to Vietnam, over them. \"It's my understanding that some of those people didn't deserve to go as boat people,\" Dau said in Vietnamese. \"So those people shouldn't have gone, but were sponsored by VOICE anyway.\" CBC spoke to two people who had been living on the margins in Thailand and say they were left off the list. Pham Ty said he arrived in Thailand in 1991 and lived at a number of refugee camps over a period of years. Almost 30 years later, he said he still lives in a town near the Thailand-Cambodian border.&nbsp; He said he applied for the Canadian resettlement program but wasn't selected and wasn't given an explanation why. \"I believe in fairness. I believe that God and Buddha and the heavens will see everything. There's no point in blaming other people,\" he said when asked whether he was upset others got into Canada instead of him. \"If I'm allowed [into Canada] I would be grateful.\" The other cases Through sources, business records, social media accounts, emails and archival footage on Vietnamese television, CBC found at least five questionable candidates for the program. One of those people is Truong Lan Anh, who according to her social media account, lives in Ottawa. She arrived in 2016 but business records for a travel company based in Vietnam, showed Truong Thi Lan Anh as the owner since 2012. Facebook photos showed her taking photos at the business in 2013. An employee at the travel agency, according to a video obtained by CBC, confirmed Truong was her employer.&nbsp; Truong did not respond to CBC's requests for comment. Another case involved Sabay Kieng. In 2014, he was welcomed to a gallery of media and supporters as he arrived in Toronto. Kieng said he had been struggling for years trying to support his family. \"I [wanted] to find a job. It's not easy so I sell some fruit on the street [in Thailand] ... to feed my son and my wife,\" he told CBC in a telephone interview. He's said he's working in automotive manufacturing in the Greater Toronto Area. But CBC obtained records, photos and videos that showed he had been running a jewelry and crafts business in Cambodia called Craftworks Cambodia since at least 2008. He travelled at one point to Manila to give a talk about his business experience at a conference. Kieng confirmed to CBC that he had businesses in Cambodia but said he did not live there, only near the border. But according to a former business associate, he lived in a house in Cambodia's capital, Phnom Penh, before coming to Canada. \"I think compared to a lot of people in Cambodia, he was living quite well,\" the business associate told CBC. \"He went straight to Canada. I mean, he had to go immediately when he got the approval.\" CBC tried reaching Kieng on the phone again but he said he was \"busy\" before hanging up. CBC made further attempts to get a comment about these inconsistencies but did not get a response. 'A very ominous cloud' Nguyen Dinh Thang, chief executive officer for Boat People S.O.S, an American non-profit organization that provides legal assistance for Vietnamese refugees abroad, had serious questions about the program as well after CBC showed him examples it had found, including the case involving Vo. \"They cannot even work legally in Thailand let alone [run] a business in Thailand or in other countries,\" said Nguyen, who was in discussions with the Vietnamese Canadian Foundation during the negotiations on the agreement. \"If they are truly stranded, they may not.\" While the MOU is vague and never specifically said that applicants had to be residing in Thailand the entire time, after reviewing CBC's examples, Nguyen does not think these are the types of people the Canadian government intended on helping based on the intent of the policy.&nbsp;&nbsp; \"None of those cases would be eligible, under this temporary special program,\" he said. The process of selecting people went like this: the VCF was responsible for identifying potential candidates, but looked to VOICE to help stranded people in Thailand complete and submit applications to Citizenship and Immigration Canada (now Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada).&nbsp; Once the list of potential applicants was passed on to Canadian immigration officials, the federal government would be responsible for interviewing people and to ultimately ensure their eligibility for entry into Canada.&nbsp;&nbsp; Nguyen, who provides legal assistance for Vietnamese refugees in Thailand, said he is \"perplexed by the lack of internal control\" by the Canadian government because if there is any suspicious activity, that would \"clearly cast a very ominous cloud\" on all refugee programs. \"It is the responsibility of immigration to screen and serve as the first line of defence to protect the integrity of the country's immigration program,\" said Nguyen. The VCF said it was not aware of any questionable candidates coming into Canada and that the final decision to let anyone into Canada rested with Canadian immigration. A senior government official involved in helping create the program told CBC the government would not have agreed to this program if it was aware of people coming from Vietnam to Thailand after repatriation or elsewhere.&nbsp; He said that it would \"undermine the claim they had no alternative option available to them.\" 'It's unfair' CBC showed VOICE co-founder Trinh Hoi examples of people who critics say did not deserve to come, including Vo.&nbsp; \"Just because someone got resettled here doesn't mean that the person cannot go back to Vietnam and visit his homeland,\" said Trinh.&nbsp; \"You cannot use one story of someone who has been able to do well or relatively well \u2026 to illustrate and say that the refugees were not stateless and were not desperate -- it's unfair,\" he said. \"When one person took advantage, and I'm not even saying [Vo] took advantage of the system, if he's eligible under the law \u2026 he should be considered if he meets [the] criteria,\" he said. Trinh said the names submitted to the Canadian government were \"eligible to the best of my knowledge\" and that his job was to \"refer those cases for consideration\" with the federal government. He denied he or his group did anything untoward, refuting the assertions in the video.&nbsp; 'We take those concerns very seriously' A government source confirmed to CBC that the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) is investigating potential violations under the Immigration, Refugee Protection Act but would not indicate who, if any, specific individuals are being investigated. Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada Minister Ahmed Hussen would not comment on any of these allegations but did say that confidence in Canada's immigration system is of utmost importance. \"I think it's important for us to continue to maintain the integrity of our system. We take any allegation of fraud or anything that threatens the integrity of our refugee system very very seriously,\" said Hussen. Hussen said he couldn't comment on the considerations that were made at the time the program was established because it was set up by the previous government. Kenney's office declined to comment on the matter and told CBC \"it's been a long time since he was immigration minister and he is fully focused on Alberta now.\""

    "body": "The family of a 10-year-old Saskatchewan girl who inspired a movement of ribbon-skirt wearing say they've seen positive changes promoting reconciliation with the Indigenous community at the school where the incident that kicked off the campaign took place. Isabella Kulak, a member of Cote First Nation, wore her ribbon skirt to a formal day in December at Kamsack Comprehensive School, in southeastern Saskatchewan, and was shamed for it by&nbsp;an educational assistant. After she told her family about the incident, her great-aunt, Judy Pelly,&nbsp;made a Facebook post and sparked a wave of support. Women and men wearing their ribbon skirts and shirts walked her to school in January, and people from around the globe began to post ribbon skirt&nbsp;photos in her name. Isabella received letters and photos from schools across Canada, 20 ribbon skirts&nbsp;and many&nbsp;ribbons to make her own skirt, which has ties to&nbsp;traditional Indigenous heritage and culture. \"Even when she's just out and about, there's people calling her, 'Are you the famous Isabella?' And 'I can't wait when I run into you next time, my grandson wants to take a picture with you.' Lots of people take pictures with her,\" said Lana Kulak, Isabella's mother. Isabella has been made an honorary member of the Saskatchewan RCMP's Indigenous women's advisory committee&nbsp;and been given numerous awards for becoming a symbol of resilience. She has also dedicated herself to her studies, earning an award for excellence in math and the Einstein Award for excellence in science. She said she would like to be a doctor one day. Her parents beam with pride as they list all of her accomplishments over the past six months, but they're also happy with what the school division has accomplished, too. After the incident in December, Quintin Robertson, director of education and CEO for Good Spirit School Division, apologized to the family and promised to do better. Since then, the school division has been following through, focusing on Indigenous education and reconciliation. Chris Kulak, Isabella's father, said he has been approached to get involved with the curriculum at the school. Although&nbsp;he isn't a teacher, he was asked to help with its land-based learning program. \"They're approaching people in the community and trying to draw on the talent and the cultural makeup of the community for staff ... rather than reaching outside the community,\" he said. \"That's what I've seen as a real change. I think it's going to change the education experience for kids no matter what their cultural background is.\" Aiming to 'do better for Indigenous kids' The school division was already making efforts at&nbsp;reconciliation and cultural programming even before the incident with Isabella. \"We've been chugging along since January and hoping to continue to do better for Indigenous kids,\" Robertson said. \"We really thank Bella for being brave and standing up for what was right. And we hope we can do better every day.\" Jesse Armstrong&nbsp;was hired by the school division in September 2020 as an&nbsp;Indigenous student success co-ordinator,&nbsp;and a second person has been hired who&nbsp;will start next school year. Both will work closely with Indigenous student coaches. The division also has Indigenous community workers at three of its schools, two in Kamsack. \"I'm working closely with schools to make sure that we're creating environments where all students feel safe, but with the focus absolutely on Indigenous students, on their safety and also on their success in many different ways \u2014 not just their academic success, but feeling like they want to be in school ... feeling like they belong in our schools,\" Armstrong said. The school division continues to work collaboratively with Indigenous communities, including Cote First Nation, where a service agreement is in the works to help bus students to Kamsack. Robertson said the First Nation will provide the drivers and the division will supply the buses. \"We really tried to take the stance of nothing about them without them,\" he said. \"We're starting to have open dialogue,\" said Chief George Cote of Cote First Nation. Cote said the Kamsack school already has visits from elders and community members, which gives&nbsp;all students an opportunity to learn about Treaty 4 territory and how the area was established. \"Racism&nbsp;was one of the things that we wanted to address. I think we are making progress, a lot of work to be done,\" he said. Robertson said the next step would be to sign service agreements with Key and Keeseekoose First Nations, noting&nbsp;it is important to listen to what the communities need when it comes to educating their kids. The division will be moving forward with a pilot project next year that will make Indigenous studies mandatory for Grade 10 students in four of its schools. Robertson said the project&nbsp;was already in the works before the school was thrust into the spotlight. But the incident really pushed it to make sure it goes ahead and is a \"strong course,\" he said. It will&nbsp;focus on treaty education, residential schools&nbsp;and reconciliation, and will be developed with help from Elder Stella Pelly. Helping teachers, all students connect with culture Armstrong, a former native studies teacher, said she will be planning some sample lessons and professional development with teachers to get them ready to teach about Indigenous people. \"I think for many years, many Canadians didn't really understand much about Indigenous people and much about the true history of Canada,\" she said. Armstrong recently did a beading activity with students in Churchbridge to teach them about residential schools, spurred by the recent preliminary discovery of what are believed to be unmarked burials sites of 215 children&nbsp;at a former residential school in Kamloops, B.C. She has also helped students connect with elders and brought in a storyteller from the community to connect virtually with students. Her team is part of a cultural project with the Ministry of Education&nbsp;that involves&nbsp;creating literary boxes with books from Indigenous authors, such as&nbsp;  by Tasha Spillett-Sumner, along with an Indigenous doll bundled in a moss bag&nbsp;and a doll-sized ribbon skirt. She said the boxes will have information about the ribbon skirt. Armstrong said she hopes it helps Indigenous students to see themselves represented and non-Indigenous students connect with the culture in a different way. Many schools across the province have Indigenous student success co-ordinators, coaches or similar roles. In Regina, they are called Indigenous student advocates. Ceane Dusyk, who works at Regina's Scott Collegiate, handles a variety of roles, including counselling, introducing elders to students, talking to teachers for students if they are uncomfortable and helping them secure funding for post-secondary education. He said the original goal was to increase graduation rates for Indigenous students, but over time he has become a safe contact for students to help them with anything. \"We are there to help develop and ensure that a relationship is there in the school, so that even schools that have a lower population of Indigenous kids, they have somebody that they can go to,\" Dusyk said. He said there weren't many teachers he could identify with when he was in high school, but now he can be that person for others. \"I really get to be a part of the community and the school and help foster that change and that direction. So that's definitely something that I'm proud of being a part of,\" Dusyk said. Education key to reconciliation The school division's work is being applauded by&nbsp;Judy Pelly, a knowledge keeper and Isabella's great-aunt. \"The school division moved in a positive direction to do something about it and [Robertson] gave his promise that it would be done,\" she said. Pelly, a residential school survivor, said&nbsp;many people are uneducated about&nbsp;the historical trauma and injustices Indigenous people in Canada have faced&nbsp;since colonization. \"In recent weeks that's really come to light, that dark history,\" she said. Pelly said learning about colonization and injustices against Indigenous people can help provide&nbsp;a picture of why they&nbsp;are&nbsp;overrepresented in the health-care system, in the criminal justice system and in child apprehension cases. Armstrong said she has seen transformative change take place in the school division and that teachers&nbsp;have been open to all of her ideas. \"When people say, 'Education will take us out of this,' I truly believe that with education and with furthering everyone's education on Indigenous people and culture, we will move toward reconciliation,\" she said."

    "body": "Standing precariously by the water's edge, the wreckage of what was once a home is one of the constant reminders of Fiona's destruction in Port aux Basques, N.L.&nbsp; Three months since the storm hit, the remains of the house \u2014 and the brown sofa thrown onto the front lawn \u2014 are still there. All an indication of the long and difficult recovery still ahead.&nbsp; While the provincial government has provided some details about the recovery plan for those whose homes were among the 101 condemned buildings, there are some families who say they're stuck in limbo.&nbsp; They're unsure what the future holds and whether they can rebuild their lives in this coastal town.&nbsp; Peggy and Lloyd Savery worked for 40 years to secure their ideal home to retire in: a blue house perched on the edge of the water.&nbsp; Now&nbsp;all that's left of that house is a small L-shaped wall.&nbsp; \"I loved it; it was my dream home,\" Peggy Savery says. \"I loved looking out my kitchen window at the ocean.\"&nbsp; She doesn't feel that way anymore.&nbsp; \"I just shake my head and wonder how I ever felt safe there because it doesn't feel safe anymore.\"&nbsp; The Saverys had home insurance&nbsp;but they were told their claim was denied because they were not covered for storm surge. Now they're left wondering if they'll get enough money from the government to start over.&nbsp; The   says, based on an assessment, each family will get a minimum of $200 reimbursement for each square foot of their home, as well as money for lost belongings and for land or a 'suitable land option.'&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the Savery home was destroyed, the family had to supply photos to show what it used to look like as part of their provincial application. \"Until the money is in the bank, you're still really nervous,\" Peggy Savery says. \"You can't make plans for the future because you don't know for sure what you're going to get.\" It's also unclear, she says, how long the process will take.&nbsp;&nbsp; The family is now living with Lloyd's niece in a different part of town \u2014 far away from the water.&nbsp; \"It's been stressful because nothing really feels like your own,\" says the couple's son, Josh. \"Everything feels temporary because it is, and you don't really know what the next day is going to bring or what the next week is going to bring.&nbsp; \"No one is really giving any good time frames or letting you know what's going to happen next.\" As for the holidays, Peggy says Christmas will be difficult not only for her family but for everyone who suffered loss.&nbsp; \"It's hard to embrace Christmas and the joy. I think after a while it gets tiresome to hear you should be thankful.\u2026 I am thankful, don't get me wrong. But it's still really hard because this is my little world and for me, I've lost everything.\" For Austin Taylor, the last three months have been full of ups and downs. Mostly downs, he says.&nbsp;&nbsp; It took him 24 years to pay off his mortgage, owning the house outright for four years. Then his home was declared condemned after Fiona; water mixed with fuel flooded his basement. Taylor, his wife and his daughter are now renting a house in town. The lease is month-to-month. \"We're here, but it's not home. We can't call it home,\" Taylor says. \"It's just a place to stay. You can't make it home because you don't know when you've got to leave. You know it's not yours, you can't do what you normally would do. It feels out of place.\"&nbsp; Though the rental unit doesn't yet feel like a home for the family, Taylor says he is trying to change that.&nbsp; The family room is full of Christmas decorations \u2014 miniature houses, Santa, the nativity scene and Mickey Mouse figurines are scattered throughout. And, of course, there's his daughter's favourite toy, Mark the Moose.&nbsp; It's all for his 29-year-old daughter, Hillary. She has a rare condition that causes developmental delays and keeps asking to go home.&nbsp; \"That's when it gets hard,\" her father says.&nbsp; Taylor says they've tried to make his daughter's room similar to the one in their house. But the stress of displacement has affected Hillary, he says. \"She'll come home from her care worker and she won't stop, she wants to go to bed. Before she'd play for hours.\" To get inside their temporary home, the Taylors have to climb 10 stairs, which isn't easy for Hillary. She has a fear of heights.&nbsp; Her care worker stands behind her, while Taylor stands in front, holding her hand as he slowly guides her down one step at a time.&nbsp; \"Sometimes she can be on that step for 15 minutes.\"&nbsp; Taylor is getting a ramp built, but work was stopped because of bad weather.&nbsp; Taylor doesn't want to rebuild; he'd rather buy an old house and fix it up. He's 58 and wonders if a bank would give him another loan.&nbsp; Like the Savery family, Taylor's insurance claim was denied.&nbsp; He paid home insurance for the last 28 years, he says \u2014 and he's still paying.&nbsp; The town has advised residents not to stop payments. They could be liable if, for example, a piece of their property flies off and causes damage to someone else's home.&nbsp; \"I feel like I got robbed twice,\" Taylor says. \"We paid the insurance, we got nothing. We still got to pay insurance and we still got nothing.\"&nbsp; He wants the town to demolish his home so that he can stop paying insurance.&nbsp; For 49 years, Dorothy Bragg and her husband, Calvin, woke up to a view of the ocean.&nbsp; But in the last few months, she knew something was different. The sea wasn't the same.&nbsp; \"The last year, I packed four times to leave our house. The sea was so high, the winds were howling,\" she says. \"I was ready to leave, because I was scared that the seas were going to come up and wash us away.\"&nbsp; On Sept. 24, as Fiona slammed into the town, the waves washed away Bragg's backyard along with a shed and nearly five-metre high wall.&nbsp;&nbsp; Her husband built the wall \u2014 logs nailed together and filled with rocks \u2014 to protect their house from the sea.&nbsp; Their house is still standing but it's been condemned. It was where the seniors were supposed to spend their retirement years.&nbsp; \"We can't go back there. It's just been very hard. I've said to my husband, 'What will we do? What are we going to do?' And he doesn't know any more than I do. It's been difficult.\" Housing is limited in the small coastal town.&nbsp; Following the storm, Bragg and her husband moved around before going to a hotel for a month. They checked out in mid-December and moved two hours north to live with their daughter near Stephenville.&nbsp; She doesn't know if they'll return to Port aux Basques. Her husband was born there and it's where she was raised. She is still active in the community, baking cakes and taking them back to town on the bus.&nbsp; Bragg hopes that as Port aux Basques rebuilds it will put up an apartment building specifically for seniors.&nbsp; No matter where Bragg ends up, one thing is for certain \u2014 she says she'll never live by the sea again.&nbsp; \"I'm just hoping and praying that things will work out for us.\" The view from the dining room is partly what sold Scott Strickland on his house. His family moved in 21 years ago, but he doesn't know if he and his wife will be allowed to stay much longer.&nbsp; Strickland's kitchen was flooded by Fiona. The siding on part of his home is gone. He was also told there is structural and electrical damage.&nbsp; \"It does play on your nerves,\" he says. \"Every creak in the wall that you hear and now you're wondering, 'Is something going to collapse?'\" Strickland says he hasn't heard anything yet from the town on whether he will be allowed to stay.&nbsp; His insurance claim was denied. He doesn't want to spend tens of thousands of dollars of his own money fixing a house that could ultimately be demolished.&nbsp; \"It's been a wild ride, a lot of anxiety, a lot of questions.\" Even if Strickland is allowed to stay he's not sure he should.&nbsp; \"It would be tough to leave, but even tougher to stay.\" Fiona tore away part of his backyard. There isn't much left separating his house from the water.&nbsp; \"You see the ocean today, it looks really beautiful and pristine, but you can hear, it's always in the back of your mind,\" he says.&nbsp; \"We're seeing a change even in the 20 years we've lived here, the storms are more frequent and more intense. I can't see how, long term, we're going to expect people to stay here or rebuild. It's just dangerous.\" Port aux Basques Mayor Brian Button agrees. He says the town is discussing what to do with people like Strickland now living in vulnerable areas.&nbsp; These are the homes that we really have to look at now and to make a decision on and say, 'Are they going to stay or are they going to go?'\" Button says, adding it's likely most people will have to move. \"Fiona has left us in a big mess. We have big decisions that have to be made.\" For now, Button says crews are trying to fix the town's infrastructure so that anyone in a vulnerable area can at least stay through the winter. There aren't enough available homes to move everyone.&nbsp; The town is also working on plans to build new homes. There are about 350 lots available in the northern part of Port aux Basques \u2014 far from the ocean.&nbsp; \"There are a lot of things going on behind the scenes of trying to get to where we need to be,\" Button says. \"The rebuild is going to be a big process.\" To help rebuild, the province has set aside $30 million in Fiona relief, while the federal government has allocated $1.3 billion to cover costs in the provinces affected by the storm. It's not yet been determined how much of that money will go to help rebuild in Port aux Basques."

    "body": "At a quiet, isolated section of the Oldman River&nbsp;in southwestern Alberta, it's a calm day. In this corner of the province, extremely strong winds can sometimes spoil outings to the river \u2014 but today, it's tranquil. That's exactly how local resident and fly fisherman Bob Costa likes it. An angler for around 40 years, Costa has long sought the refuge of fishing, whether solo or with a companion. \"It's an environment that has always caused me to find peace. Peace and relaxation,\" Costa said. \"I would hate to see that disrupted.\" In this&nbsp;section of the Oldman, Costa explains, there's a great deal of structure. There are rocks on the dry bank&nbsp;and in the river itself. And the more cover you have, the greater the chances of finding fish like&nbsp;rainbow trout, bull trout and&nbsp;cutthroat trout. But this year, Costa said, he's been seeing some of the lowest flow rates on the river he can ever recall. \"The&nbsp;river finds its way lower and lower and lower,\" Costa said.&nbsp;\"In fact,&nbsp;to the point that as low as it is now, I won't even fish it. Because the fish are too stressed, and they're in oxygen debt.\" What's happening in this section of the Oldman River comes as no surprise, experts say, and the effects of climate change could lead to water shortages across Alberta&nbsp;in years to come.        \"We're already in the climate catastrophe era,\" said James Byrne, a geography professor at the University of Lethbridge who has studied climate change for more than 30 years. Concerns over water shortages in southern Alberta No part of the globe or this country&nbsp;is immune from the effects of climate change. But Canada's Prairie provinces could be particularly hard hit, experts say, due to the fact&nbsp;they are among the highest industrial and commercial users of water in the country, partly because of the agricultural sector.&nbsp; In dry southern Alberta, the agricultural sector relies on irrigation&nbsp;\u2014 the process of watering crops artificially instead of relying on rainfall. Last October, the provincial government announced Alberta's irrigation system  , which would be used to bury canals, add 208,000 acres of irrigable land and expand storage. The use of water in the southern part of Alberta is restricted. New licences for water can't be issued; they must be purchased from existing licence holders. But even the current allocation of water licences in southern Alberta could&nbsp;come under stress due to extreme weather variability, said University of Lethbridge geography professor Stefan Kienzle, who created an interactive website that  . \"We have allocated 100 per cent of our water. We cannot allocate any more,\" Kienzle said. \"The biggest threat facing southern Alberta is multi-year droughts&nbsp;\u2026 maybe the [irrigators] can get away with scraping by&nbsp;two years. \"But if you have a drought that is longer than two years, you are done. Irrigation is done. The productivity is done. We will all scramble for water as municipalities and industries to keep our faucets going.\" Alberta experienced record-breaking temperatures this past summer, with scorching heat above 35 C for days. Several provincial municipalities declared  &nbsp;due to drought, and livestock producers struggling to feed their cattle were forced to sell herds  . Agriculture, of course, is a key driver of Alberta's economy, contributing $9.2 billion to the province's GDP in 2019.&nbsp; Minister says province&nbsp;monitors&nbsp;situation Jason Nixon, Alberta's minister of environment and parks, said the province's licensing program would allow it to react in the potential scenario of water shortages. In addition, Nixon said, the province has water   that it is entitled to, meaning there is additional water still available within the system. \"That said, we recognize how precious&nbsp;the basin is, which is why it's a closed basin. We continue to monitor it accordingly and adjust,\" Nixon said. The focus right now, he said, is on continuing to upgrade&nbsp;irrigation systems in southern Alberta. \"[That way], we'll be able to make sure we are able to utilize all the water resources that we have.\" Nixon&nbsp;cited this year's drought conditions as an example of the province's capability to adjust to shortages. \"As time goes on, we will of course have to make adjustments to [the&nbsp;Oldman River basin], to make sure it can do its No. 1 job, which is to make sure we can provide habitat for important species like&nbsp;westslope cutthroat, as well as drinking water for people of southern Alberta.\" Weight of additional stressors Last fall, a government presentation  proposed changes to water allocations in the province's arid southwest. The presentation included details that would have removed sector barriers for industrial users&nbsp;such as coal producers. In March of this year, Nixon said there  . On Monday, Nixon said no water allocations are being increased for any coal or industrial activity on the South Saskatchewan Basin, particularly in the Oldman region. \"There is limited water resources within that area. There will be no new allocation or licences made available for any industry inside the Oldman basin, and any projects would have to work within the existing water framework,\" he said. This summer, the federal government   in southwestern Alberta, nearly two months after a review panel denied a provincial application for the project, citing&nbsp;the effects on surface water quality and the threatened westslope cutthroat trout. The company behind the project, Benga Mining Limited, is  . But&nbsp;in southern Alberta and elsewhere across the province, it's the combined weight of human activity that is taxing an already limited water supply, said&nbsp;Katie Morrison, conservation director with the southern Alberta chapter of the Canadian Parks and Wilderness Society (CPAWS). Heavy forestry, motorized recreation and industrial use are having a big impact on the resource, Morrison said. Coal mining in source-water areas in other parts of the province also uses&nbsp;a lot of water and poses a risk of water contamination, she said. \"All of those things together&nbsp;\u2026&nbsp;are really placing a stress on this resource that is one of our most valuable resources in the province.\" What's to be done? Byrne, the geography professor at the University of Lethbridge,&nbsp;said now is the time to transition Alberta's&nbsp;economy toward&nbsp;renewable energy. \"If we don't redevelop our economy to take advantage of renewable energy, then we're going to see a decline in our economy,\" he said. \"So there's less money for everything. We just can't afford the things we have. So that's tax increases, that's cuts in services. We don't want our economy to slide because of water shortages.\" Less than an hour north of Lethbridge&nbsp;is Lismore Farms, a mixed irrigation and dryland operation. Dryland farming refers to the growing of crops without the use of&nbsp;irrigation in dry areas. It is at operations like these where drought conditions and water shortages are not just problems discussed hypothetically. Owner Malcolm MacDougall said yields from the farm&nbsp;were&nbsp;very poor this year. In a typical year, the farm would see 50 bushels per acre of&nbsp;wheat crops. This year, the farm saw five to eight bushels to the acre on the dryland. It was a similar story&nbsp;when it came to canola crops on the farm. The farm usually sees 40 to 50 bushels per acre of canola crops, and this year&nbsp;it saw anywhere from one to five bushels per acre. \"Take 70 to 80 per cent off your paycheque and see how you get through the next year,\" MacDougall said. \"It's pretty bleak.\" All told, MacDougall said, this year was by far the worst&nbsp;in the 37 years he's been working on the farm. Southern Alberta is no stranger to drought conditions. MacDougall himself went through the droughts of the&nbsp;1980s, and he's hopeful next year will be better. \"I've been around for some of those really bad ones,\" he said. \"My dad used to say, 'When Noah built the arc, and it rained for 40 days and 40 nights, this area got half an inch.'\" Caitlin Hanrahan, an associate professor in the department of geography and environment at the University of Lethbridge, said there is evidence of what is to come in the hot, dry, smoky summer experienced across the Prairies. \"Glaciers and ice caps [are]&nbsp;melting. So we're going to have less water in the future, and we're all going to feel it.\" ."

    "body": "Prince Charles and Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall toured Ottawa on this second day of their royal visit to mark&nbsp;the Queen's Platinum Jubilee \u2014 a city he recently called \"the much-storied capital at the heart of a great nation.\" The heir to the throne and the future Queen consort are taking part&nbsp;in their first visit to Canada in five years. That&nbsp;lengthy absence was largely due to the COVID-19 health crisis bringing&nbsp;this sort of travel to a halt. While they've been away for a while, Charles is no stranger to Canada \u2014 this is his 19th visit. The jam-packed day \u2014&nbsp;filled with Canadiana like&nbsp;the RCMP&nbsp;musical ride and more heady subjects like the war in Ukraine and the efforts to rescue refugees from war-torn regions \u2014 was drama-free&nbsp;for the Royal Family, which has faced its fair share for scandal over the last two years. While Prince William and Catharine, Duchess of Cambridge faced protests during their eight-day swing through the Caribbean earlier this year, Charles and Camilla were warmly welcomed at every stop in the nation's capital. Polls suggest Charles is much&nbsp;less popular than this mother, the Queen, but there was no signs of opposition today&nbsp;as thousands came out for a chance to see the next king. Charles's itinerary for the tour was planned by Canadian Heritage, the federal department that manages all things royal, with input from the Prime Minister's Office. It was an itinerary tailor-made for the Prince and his wife as it features&nbsp;discussions about climate change, literacy and Indigenous peoples \u2014 issues the two royals champion in the U.K. and throughout the&nbsp;Commonwealth. Charles started the day with Governor General Mary Simon and her husband, Whit Fraser. While at Rideau Hall \u2014 the official residence for visiting members of the Royal Family&nbsp;\u2014 Charles was invested as an&nbsp;extraordinary commander in the Order of Military Merit, an order that recognizes&nbsp;exceptional service by active members of the Canadian Armed Forces (CAF). In his lifetime, Charles has&nbsp;accepted nine honorary appointments and three honorary ranks in the CAF. Charles and Camilla then travelled to the National War Memorial \u2014&nbsp; &nbsp;during this winter's trucker convoy protests \u2014 to lay a wreath and a bouquet of flowers to honour Canada's war dead. Charles, who is the colonel-in-chief of the Black Watch, Royal Highland Regiment, inspected some of the assembled military personnel. Camilla did the same for the Queen's Own Rifles of Canada, a Toronto regiment of which she is the honorary colonel. A bugler played the Last Post and the Piper's Lament followed \u2014&nbsp;songs traditionally played at Remembrance Day ceremonies. Remarkably, the police left the streets that surround the memorial open to vehicular traffic. About a thousand people, some of them carrying Canadian, British and Ukrainian flags, gathered around the perimeter of the memorial to catch a glimpse of the visiting couple. After the short military ceremony, the couple wandered into the crowd to shake hands with eager royal watchers, some of whom shouted, \"Please come this way!\" and \"Thanks for coming!\" Among the well-wishers&nbsp;was Cecile Dumont, 63, who&nbsp;travelled across the river from Quebec&nbsp;to see the the couple. She managed to get a selfie with Charles&nbsp;and she was shaking as they captured the image. \"I love him, really I do,\" she said, adding she arrived four hours before the ceremony. \"He's a wonderful man and our future king. I think the popularity of the monarchy is declining but I absolutely love the royals. I think he will make a wonderful monarch. I think it is good for our government to have a Royal Family. It's dual responsibility.\" The couple then ventured over to the&nbsp;ByWard Market, the farmer's market in the city centre. Charles \u2014&nbsp;a well-known proponent of&nbsp;organic farming \u2014&nbsp;spoke to local vendors at stalls overflowing with seasonal produce like garlic and fiddleheads. During a walkabout, the couple were&nbsp;mobbed by locals eager to lay eyes on the future king. The noticeably skittish security team kept a watchful eye on the crowds and struggled to keep onlookers a few feet from the couple as they walked. Visiting members of the British press corps got a chance to sample the celebrated fried dough pastries&nbsp;for sale at the Beavertails stand as the royal couple passed by. \"It's Prince Charles!\" said the stall's owner, Pam Hooker, as the Queen's son approached. \"It's a glorious day,\" Camilla said as Hooker stood holding a tray of the pastries. Weather conditions in Ottawa were close to perfect at 1 p.m., with full sun and a high of 16 C. Under clear blue skies, the royal couple took in a performance of the RCMP's famed musical ride with well over a thousand well wishers on hand \u2014 the first performance of this elaborate equestrian&nbsp;routine&nbsp;since the&nbsp;start&nbsp;of the pandemic. Sitting next to RCMP Commissioner Brenda Lucki,&nbsp;Charles and Camilla appeared amused as the 32-horse cavalry dazzled the crowd with their skills,&nbsp;choreographed to well-known Canadian songs like Shania Twain's \"Up.\" The riders, all regular RCMP officers, showed off tricks like the \"clover leaf\" and the \"star\" as the crowd cheered. \"It's a honour to host the royals. It's been a long time since they were here and we know they just love horses,\" said&nbsp;Insp. Roshan Pinto, an RCMP officer in red serge&nbsp;on hand to escort the royals. \"His Royal Highness&nbsp;is our commissioner-in-chief so we have that connection, we have strong ties with the royals. I'm hoping it strengthens the bonds between Canada and the family.\" After the ride, Charles had a bilateral meeting with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in the opulent Large Drawing Room at Rideau Hall, a space often used to entertain visiting heads of state. \"It's wonderful to be able to sit down with you to talk about so many things that are going on in Canada and continue the work that you have been doing on the environment and so many different issues that matter. It's a real pleasure to welcome you here,\" Trudeau said to Charles. \"It is always a joy to come to Canada,\" the prince said in response. Alongside Trudeau, Charles participated in a roundtable on \"sustainable finance\" to promote market-based solutions to climate change. For the second time in two days, Charles made a point of publicly praising Canada for its efforts to&nbsp;welcome refugees. \"We have met all sorts of people and I must say I am so full of admiration for the Canadian approach to welcoming so many people who are displaced from all these conflict-ridden parts of the world,\" he said. \"So many communities and individuals have sponsored refugees. It is remarkable how welcoming everyone was.\" Meetings&nbsp;with Ukrainian community, refugees Charles also praised Canada's efforts to support Ukraine as it fights off&nbsp;Russian aggression, and its efforts to&nbsp;tackle climate change through green initiatives. With those issues top of mind on this tour, Charles visited the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Ukrainian Orthodox Cathedral to meet with members of the local Ukrainian-Canadian community. He participated in a prayer with the congregation and dined on perogies. At a&nbsp;solo engagement, Camilla visited Assumption School in Ottawa's Vanier neighbourhood, an ethnically diverse and low-income part of the city, to meet with students and promote literacy projects. Camilla, an avid reader&nbsp;who launched a book club last year, read the children's book The Library Bus, a story about the struggles girls face in Afghanistan, to Grade One students. She spoke in French with the schoolchildren \u2014&nbsp;many of them African migrants and refugees. \"Everybody is on their best behaviour!\" she said while a teacher demonstrated the school's book \"vending machine,\" which pops out a new book for the children to read every month. Charles&nbsp;has said he'll use this tour to learn more about what Canada is doing to reconcile with Indigenous peoples after centuries of colonial violence. Charles said that, before the trip, he spoke with Governor General&nbsp;Simon about the country's reconciliation efforts. Simon \u2014 the first Indigenous person to serve in this role \u2014 will host the royal couple at Rideau Hall later this evening. \"As we look to our collective future as one people, sharing one planet, we must find new ways to come to terms with the darker and more difficult aspects of the past,\" Charles said&nbsp;Tuesday. \"Acknowledging, reconciling and striving to do better \u2014 it is a process that starts with listening.\" On tomorrow's leg of the three-day trip, Charles will meet with Indigenous peoples in the Northwest Territories. This relatively short three-day royal tour has been criticized by some monarchists in Canada. Monarchists have said Canada \u2014&nbsp;one of the senior members of the Commonwealth of Nations&nbsp;and a country with a long&nbsp;history with&nbsp;the Crown \u2014 deserved more in this special&nbsp;year. 'We need to see the future king' Nathan Tidridge, the vice-president of the Institute for the Study of the Crown in Canada&nbsp;and a researcher on Crown-Indigenous relations, said it's important for Charles and other members of the Royal Family to routinely visit Canada to continue the centuries-long relationship between Indigenous peoples and the Crown. While he's also frustrated with the tour's constrained timeline, Tidridge said he's happy to see that the itinerary&nbsp;includes time for engagement with Indigenous peoples. \"We need to&nbsp;see the future king in this country. The Queen famously said, 'I need to be seen to be believed,' and the same is true here,\" Tidridge said."

    "body": "The new chief of Manitoba's most populous First Nation wants to know why riverfront property it purchased in one of Winnipeg's most desirable residential neighbourhoods was flipped to a private developer instead of becoming part of its reserve lands. Peguis First Nation acquired nearly three acres of land on the north side of Winnipeg's Wellington Crescent from the province in 2022 for $350,000, a sale price one real-estate professional calls \"ridiculously low.\" Less than a year later, that land was sold to a private developer who's now planning to build upscale condos along the Assiniboine River. Peguis Chief Stan Bird said he's investigating the sale and resale of the land at 611 Wellington Cres., among other actions involving the Peguis First Nation Real Estate Trust, which has the stated goal of creating housing and engaging in off-reserve development. \"We're looking at financial records. We're looking at past correspondence, documentation, whatever we can get our hands on to shed light on why things were done a certain way or why certain deals were even carried out,\" said Bird, who was elected chief of the northern Interlake Cree and Ojibway community in April 2023. \"Our land is very much tied to our identity as a people. I mean, our language comes from the land, and without land, there is no culture. Without culture, of course, there is no identity, right? So our land is our identity.\" The initial sale of the Wellington Crescent land took place in July 2022, when the province of Manitoba sold 2.8 acres of land on the river side of the leafy, mansion-lined boulevard to a numbered company owned by the chief and council of Peguis First Nation on behalf of its members. The sale price: $350,000, or close to the value of an average single-family home in Winnipeg at the time.&nbsp; The province says the transaction fell under the treaty land entitlement process, a mechanism intended to settle the land debt owed to First Nations that didn't receive all the property they were promised by the Crown. The sale price was heavily discounted due to what the province described as the distressed state of the property, which required riverbank stabilization, asbestos removal and the demolition of an old hospital. Unlike dozens of previous acquisitions under the treaty land entitlement process, Peguis did not apply to incorporate the Wellington Crescent property into its reserve, Indigenous Services Canada said. About six months after the Peguis-owned numbered company purchased the Wellington Crescent land, that company was sold to a private developer who now plans to build 14 luxury homes on the property. The Peguis First Nation Real Estate Trust declared on its website the land was sold for $2.8 million but pegged profits on the land flip at $1.8 million. Chief Bird said he's investigating the transactions because he doesn't know why the riverfront plot was flipped. \"I don't know why the land was purchased and sold to a private developer,\" Bird said. \"We are concerned about this purchase and we are continuing to investigate.\" Greg Stevenson, a trustee with the Peguis First Nation Real Estate Trust, questioned why Bird is concerned about the transactions. \"It's just a normal business deal, right?\" said Stevenson, who also works as a consultant for M. Richard &amp; Associates, a Winnipeg planning firm. \"There's nothing that's different from any other business deal.\" Bird has been chief for almost a year and ought to be familiar with the transactions, Stevenson said. Long struggle to regain land Peguis First Nation has struggled for more than a century to receive compensation for the lands it lost after European settlers arrived in the province.&nbsp; Its reserve lands once included fertile agricultural tracts at St. Peter's, along the Red River, in what's now the rural municipality of St. Clements. In 1907, the First Nation was forced to surrender that land and move to a flood-prone area of the northern Interlake. In a treaty land entitlement agreement in 2008, Peguis received $64 million plus a commitment of 167,000 acres of both Crown and private land. The following year, the federal government paid Peguis $126 million to settle the illegal surrender of the reserve property northeast of Selkirk. Bird said acquiring the Wellington Crescent property under the treaty land entitlement process and then flipping it for a profit is at odds with Peguis's efforts to regain what it lost. \"It's not simply a monetary exchange for a piece of property. It goes far beyond that,\" said Bird, describing any profit realized by Peguis in the transaction as a secondary consideration. \"The fact is that we were swindled out of land, and there's a process in place now for us to regain some of that. I think that has to be the primary consideration.\" Peguis&nbsp;has other financial pressures. The First Nation is fighting a $172-million lawsuit from the court-appointed receiver for an insolvent Toronto&nbsp;lender that provided Peguis loans at an interest rate of prime plus 11 per cent. As well, Indigenous Services Canada has&nbsp;required Peguis since 2016 to develop a management plan to deal with an issue with the way the First Nation handles its finances, Indigenous Services Canada spokesperson Anispiragas Piragasanathar said. Shriner's hospital no more The riverfront land at 611 Wellington Cres. was formerly a children's hospital. The facility opened in 1949 as the Shriner's Hospital for Crippled Children and was turned over to the province of Manitoba in 1977, when it became the Rehabilitation Centre for Children, the Manitoba Historical Society says. The rehab centre ceased operating at that site&nbsp;in 2016. The province declared the riverfront plot surplus three years later, and then in 2020, offered it to five First Nations eligible to acquire Crown lands under the treaty land-entitlement process: Peguis, Brokenhead, Long Plain, Roseau River and Swan Lake. Peguis was the only one of the five to express an interest in the property, the province said. In fall 2021, Peguis consultant Andrew Marquess \u2014 best known as the developer of the Parker lands and other properties along Winnipeg's rapid-transit corridor \u2014 commissioned several studies about 611 Wellington Cres.&nbsp; Records obtained by CBC News from a confidential source show a Marquess-owned company commissioned a riverbank assessment that estimated any future development of the site would require $1.9 million worth of stabilization work. Those records also show a former Marquess employee named Walter Parfeniuk received a $276,000 estimate, plus GST, for demolishing the former hospital, excavating the site and removing hazardous waste. In a&nbsp;Dec. 11, 2021, email obtained by CBC News, Marquess advised Peguis First Nation's chief and council that he created a company that \"will take title\" of 611 Wellington Cres., and the&nbsp;company would be owned by the Peguis First Nation Real Estate Trust. Marquess said Peguis could subdivide the property into several lots and sell them, generating a profit in the range of $2.1 million to $2.5 million. \"I think this is a good purchase and I can make this happen,\" Marquess advised in an email obtained by CBC News. \"Peguis should move forward with this purchase.\" Marquess then asked Winnipeg property-appraisal firm Browaty &amp; Associates to determine the value of the land. That appraisal, obtained by CBC News, pegged the market value of 611 Wellington Cres. at&nbsp;$1.8 million. The estimate also said the land would be worth as much as $5.4 million if the profit for the developer, a realty commission, \"miscellaneous expenses\" and costs for demolition and riverbank stabilization were not taken into account. The province ended up selling the plot for $350,000 in a transaction that concluded on July 11, 2022. The province said the sale price was based on an appraisal of the land's fair market value, in \"as is\" condition, conducted by Altus Group in 2017. While the province declined repeated requests to make this appraisal public, a senior provincial official said that valuation took into account the need to do $4.3 million worth of riverbank stabilization at the site, remove asbestos from the old hospital and demolish the 1949 structure. \"That was a super distressed property,\" said the senior provincial official, who spoke to CBC News on the condition their name would not be published. \"If anybody wanted to repurpose it, it would cost an absolute fortune.\" The official could not explain the apparent gulf between the financial assumptions underlying the province's 2017 appraisal and the ones from the documents commissioned by Marquess in 2021 and 2022.&nbsp; In a&nbsp;2023 tax notice, the City of Winnipeg assessed the property at $4.9 million. 'Ridiculously low' price Bob Antymniuk, a commercial real estate broker in Winnipeg, described the $350,000 sale price for the 2.8-acre Wellington Crescent parcel as \"ridiculously low,\" even when the cost of improvements is factored in. \"I think that this land ought to be probably worth at least $1.5 million an acre, likely more,\" Antymniuk said in an interview at the Portage Avenue office of his firm, Capital Commercial Real Estate Services. A very long list of developers would have lined up for a shot at purchasing nearly three acres of riverfront land on Wellington Crescent for $350,000, he said. \"It'd be a very, very desirable piece of property, especially for that price,\" he said. Marquess implied Peguis received a discount from the province because it is a First Nation. \"You and I don't get that opportunity,\" he said when asked about the $350,000 sale price in a January interview. \"I'm not sure it's a fair question, given all the other factors of the province's role and relationship with Indigenous communities.\"&nbsp; According to the framework for the sale of lands under the treaty land entitlement process, surplus Crown lands are supposed to be sold at fair market value. But there are occasions when Crown land is sold to First Nations below fair market value, said Yvan Guy Larocque, a M\u00e9tis lawyer in Winnipeg with expertise in treaty land entitlement. \"It is in the spirit of reconciliation, I think, when those things happen,\" said Larocque, the founder of Larocque Business Law and a clinical instructor in the faculty of law at the University of Manitoba. Such discounts can be seen as economic reconciliation, Larocque said. The senior provincial official who spoke to CBC News about the sale of 611 Wellington Cres. made no mention of a reconciliation-related discount. That official said the provincial Treasury Board ultimately approved the sale. What Peguis did with the land after it was purchased is not something the province would question, the official suggested. 'Nothing like it' Ten days after Peguis-controlled 10115382 Manitoba Inc. purchased 611 Wellington Cres., the Marquess-owned 6748831 Manitoba Inc. applied for a demolition permit. The building was demolished in October 2022.&nbsp; Three months later, Peguis parted ways with the land. On Jan. 27, 2023, developer Marc Kipnes and his company Crystal Ionics purchased 10115382 Manitoba Inc. in a transaction listed at $2.8 million on the Peguis First Nation Real Estate Trust website. Kipnes has a 17-year track record of developing condos in Tuxedo, South St. Vital and other Winnipeg neighbourhoods. Kipnes confirmed he purchased the numbered company that held title to the land after he was informed it was available by Tom Blumberg, a broker with Winnipeg's Monopoly Realty. \"There's nothing like it,\" Kipnes said via text. He plans to ask city council to rezone the land this spring so he can build 14 units on the land. Blumberg said he'd been interested in 611 Wellington Cres. ever since the former children's rehabilitation centre closed in 2016, and he contacted the minister about its availability before it was sold to Peguis. Blumberg said his earlier interest must have been noted. \"My name was obviously left on the list somehow and it got back to Andrew Marquess, who was basically running the group for Peguis, doing their consulting work,\" Blumberg said in a telephone interview. Marquess also invited several other parties to bid, he said. \"That never really got to the general public, per se, but he did contact and reach out to a number of different parties,\" he said. \"I happened to have a group that I knew that had been interested in the land for a long time.\" Blumberg said his group, led by Kipnes, made a successful offer to purchase the land as part of a sealed bid process. What the real estate trust described as a $2.8-million deal did not include the riverbank stabilization work. The scope of that won't be determined until city council approves the final design, Blumberg said. \"It's pretty hard to undertake the stabilization until you know what exactly you're building,\" he said. 'Our community was left in the dark' Sitting in his office in Peguis First Nation, Chief Bird said he doesn't know why Peguis bought and then sold valuable residential property it could have developed on its own. \"It put us in a really good position, but again, that was taken away. So my question is, why?\" he asked. \"I feel a bit angry about that. Our community was left in the dark.\"        Stevenson, the trustee with the Peguis First Nation Investment Trust, said the trust operates autonomously and had every right to flip the Wellington Crescent land. Every transaction the trust undertakes is for the benefit of Peguis First Nation, Stevenson said, and he is not sure why Bird did not simply call him if he has questions. \"We're trying to build a community here using our real estate trust, knowledge and the people we work with,\" he said. \"This seems like it's a hurdle being built to prevent us from doing that.\" In a subsequent email, Stevenson said the trustees for Peguis First Nation Real Estate Trust have been trying to meet with Bird but have not been able to secure&nbsp;a meeting. \"We would welcome a meeting at any time if the chief and council have time in their schedule,\" Stevenson said. Bird said he does not understand the information he has seen and he has further questions about Peguis First Nation Real Estate Trust's accounting of the 611 Wellington sale. In a   posted on the real estate trust's website, the profits are listed as $1.83-million.&nbsp;  posted by the Peguis First Nation Investment Trust say the gross profits on a $2.8-million sale are $1.44 million. In a text message, Stevenson said he checked with his accountant to explain the roughly $400,000 difference between the two stated profits. He said $350,000 was for the land purchase and $50,000 was for consulting and legal fees. Bird said he also has questions for Marquess, whom he characterized as the architect of the 611 Wellington Cres. purchase and sale. Marquess said it was not his idea for Peguis to purchase 611 Wellington Cres. \"I didn't find out about the land being available. It was the real estate trust that found out,\" he said. \"They obviously had been talking to the province and then came to me.\" The Winnipeg developer said he only tried to provide some advice to the Peguis trust. \"We helped out on some experts and engineering reports, and there's a lot of challenges with the land, riverbank stabilization.\" When asked about the role of his former employee Parfeniuk in the 611 Wellington Cres. project, Marquess said he asked Parfeniuk to solicit a demolition quote. Stevenson described Parfeniuk as a real estate advisor to the Peguis First Nation Real Estate Trust. Marquess said he didn't know why Parfeniuk was appointed a year and a half ago as a director of the Chief Peguis Investment Corporation, a separate company created more than a decade ago to pursue investments on behalf of Peguis First Nation. Parfeniuk declined an interview request.&nbsp; Marquess ultimately deferred questions about 611 Wellington Cres. to Stevenson.&nbsp; Stevenson, in turn, described Marquess both as an advisor and developer for the real estate trust. Stevenson said Marquess continues to work for the real estate trust. Ryan McCorrister, another trustee with the Peguis First Nation Real Estate Trust and the director of the numbered company that bought 611 Wellington Cres. from the province, deferred questions about the real estate trust's finances to Marquess.&nbsp; McCorrister deferred questions about the land transactions to Glenn Hudson, who served as the chief of Peguis First Nation before Bird was elected. Hudson said he has no comment on the 611 Wellington sale because it was \"completed and done under Peguis [First Nation] Real Estate Trust.\" Lawyer: No reason First Nations can't flip land Larocque, the Winnipeg lawyer, said it is common to see a new chief and council criticize the actions of the preceding leadership at a First Nation. \"It's politics,\" he said. \"It's no different than the NDP discovering a larger deficit and blaming the PCs, right? So we have to take that with a grain of salt.\" Larocque said there's no reason a First Nation has to hold on to land it acquires from the Crown under the treaty land entitlement process. First Nations that buy and sell land can be seen as exercising their rights, he said. \"They have autonomy and they have a right to self-determination in relation to economic development and self-governance,\" Larocque said. \"So if their internal processes were followed and their council at the time made a decision that was in the best interest of the nation, I don't see an issue with it.&nbsp; \"However, it sounds like potentially there's some question around that.\" Chief Bird made it clear that he has questions about the resale of property acquired under the treaty land process. \"The whole nature of that trust was to improve the lives of our people, but that hasn't improved the lives of our people.\" 611 Wellington Crescent: A timeline : The Shriner's Hospital for Crippled Children opens at 611 Wellington Cres. : The hospital is transferred to the province and becomes the Rehabilitation Centre for Children. : The rehabilitation centre moves to a new site. : Altus Group does a property appraisal of 611 Wellington Cres. for the province. : The province declares 611 Wellington Cres. surplus to its needs. : The province offers the land to five First Nations, including Peguis. : The Peguis First Nation Real Estate Trust is created.

    "body": "Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has named eight new members to his cabinet as he continues to face pressure to step down. Friday's shuffle comes after Chrystia Freeland resigned as deputy prime minister and finance minister, spurring an emboldened movement within the Liberal caucus to push the prime minister out of the leadership chair. One senior government source told CBC News the timing and size of the shuffle should not be taken as a signal that the prime minister has made up his mind about his future, adding Trudeau is still \"reflecting\" on his position. The purpose of the shuffle is to make sure the cabinet is complete so the government can function properly, the source said.&nbsp; Here are some of the new faces tapped to join what could be Trudeau's&nbsp;last cabinet. Nathaniel Erskine-Smith Toronto-area MP Nathaniel Erskine-Smith is taking&nbsp;over as minister of housing. Erskine-Smith was&nbsp;elected when the Liberals first formed government in 2015. Since then, he's gained a reputation as a backbencher who isn't afraid to   \u2014 or   \u2014 his own party. The new minister has disagreed with the government on   and expressed doubt about its use of the  . He also has pushed his party to move further on policies related to animal welfare and drug legalization. Last year, Erskine-Smith ran a failed bid for the leadership of the Ontario Liberal Party. He came in second behind Bonnie Crombie after three rounds of voting. Erskine-Smith announced earlier this year that he wouldn't run for re-election, but that appears to have changed with this appointment. &nbsp; David McGuinty David McGuinty, the MP for Ottawa-South, joins cabinet as the minister of public safety. McGuinty comes into the ministerial role after serving as the first chair of the National Security and Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians (NSICOP). That committee dropped a   earlier this year that said a number of parliamentarians were \"'semi-witting or witting' participants in the efforts of foreign states to interfere in our politics.\" In    , NSICOP also&nbsp;has called on the Liberal government to do more to address foreign interference. McGuinty was first elected in 2004; this is his&nbsp;first cabinet appointment. His brother&nbsp;Dalton McGuinty Jr. is a former Ontario premier and his father Dalton McGuinty Sr. was an MPP. Rachel Bendayan&nbsp; Montreal MP Rachel Bendayan has been tapped as minister of official languages and associate minister of public safety. First elected in 2019, Bendayan&nbsp;has&nbsp;served as Freeland's parliamentary secretary for the past year. Her promotion to cabinet follows Trudeau's pattern of&nbsp;elevating&nbsp;the finance minister's parliamentary secretaries&nbsp;to the front bench \u2014 Sean Fraser, Fran\u00e7ois-Philippe Champagne and Ginette Petitpas Taylor all served in that role before becoming ministers. Bendayan first ran in 2015 but lost&nbsp;to then-NDP leader Thomas Mulcair. She worked as a Liberal staffer before winning the seat in a 2019 byelection. Bendayan has been a vocal supporter of the Liberals'&nbsp;recent gun control measures. \u00c9cole Polytechnique de Montr\u00e9al \u2014 the location of the 1989 Montreal massacre \u2014 is in her riding. She was part of the government's&nbsp;recent press conference announcing the addition of  . A lawyer by trade, Bendayan previously taught at Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al's law school. Ruby Sahota&nbsp; Brampton MP Ruby Sahota has been named minister of democratic institutions and&nbsp;minister responsible for the Federal Economic Development Agency for Southern Ontario. First elected in 2015, Sahota had been serving as the Liberal whip and previously had been deputy whip. Sahota is a member of a number of parliamentary associations and interparliamentary groups, including the NATO parliamentary association and the Canada-U.S. interparliamentary group. Sahota's promotion to cabinet means Trudeau will need to name a new whip \u2014 a caucus management role \u2014 at a time of growing discontent in&nbsp;the Liberal ranks. Terry Duguid&nbsp; Terry Duguid will be Manitoba's new representative at the cabinet table. The MP for Winnipeg South was named the minister of sport and minister responsible for Prairies Economic Development Canada. A former Winnipeg city councillor, Duguid was first elected as an MP in 2015. He's held a number of parliamentary secretary positions, most recently to the prime minister himself. A long-time environmentalist, Duguid&nbsp;also served&nbsp;as an adviser to Trudeau on water issues. In the past, Duguid served as a chairman of the Manitoba Clean Environment Commission and executive director of the Manitoba Climate Change Task Force. Darren Fisher Dartmouth-Cole Harbour MP Darren Fisher will be representing Nova Scotia in Trudeau's cabinet after Sean Fraser announced earlier this week that he would not seek re-election. Fisher is the new minister of veterans affairs and associate minister of national defence. A former member of the Halifax regional council, Fisher was first elected to the House of Commons in 2015. Like McGuinty, Fisher was a member of NSICOP. Prior to joining that committee, he held a number of parliamentary secretary roles. Fisher was a small business owner before entering politics, according to his website. Joanne Thompson Joanne Thompson, the MP for St. John's East, has become the new minister of seniors. Thompson is a relatively new MP; she won her seat in&nbsp;the last federal election in 2021. She comes to her new&nbsp;role after serving as the national chair of the Liberals' seniors caucus. A registered nurse, Thompson has a history of volunteer work. She was&nbsp;the executive director of The Gathering Place, a health centre that serves vulnerable populations in downtown St. John's. \u00c9lisabeth Bri\u00e8re \u00c9lisabeth Bri\u00e8re, the MP for Sherbooke, Que., is another parliamentary secretary who&nbsp;received a promotion on Friday. Bri\u00e8re will take over as minister of national revenue, a file that \u2014 under Trudeau \u2014 has been held by two other&nbsp;Quebecers: Diane Lebouthillier and Marie-Claude Bibeau. Since first being elected in 2019, Bri\u00e8re has held a number of parliamentary secretary roles. Most recently she has been pulling double-duty as&nbsp;parliamentary secretary to the minister of families and to the minister of mental health and addictions. Prior to joining politics, she worked at a law firm in Sherbrooke."

Suffice it to say that I think the man is a menace. And to do an event in a venue where he has essentially orchestrated a coup would be to pretty much appear to be complicit, to support what it is he's done not only there, but elsewhere. I wish I could say that it was a decision that I struggled over, but it wasn't. There was no decision tree at all. There was absolutely no doubt that it was the only thing I could do.&nbsp; : Amanda, let's set aside what you would have earned from it or what you would have spent to make the show happen. What has the cost of cancelling this show been for you? Like, what are you giving up?&nbsp; : I don't know that it's cost me anything at this point, because I think that doing the performance would have cost me more, even emotionally and spiritually. Aside from the financial things I've already spent to try to go and work in America, I think that I've actually gained more. I think this is the time where we need to be aligning with our values. It's more important than ever. To me, that's worth everything. This is the most important time I think even as Canadians in Canada, let alone what's going on south of the border, to come together with like-minded people. We can make a difference even if it feels sometimes like we can't. Anytime I do a concert, you know, those people that come to those shows, we're gathering together, and there's strength and connection in that. I think that this is a really beautiful thing that we can do. Even when we feel like we can't make the biggest difference, you know, we can. It happens in those community-based places.&nbsp; : Louise, I know you said that you've already culled your followers with a previous book, but do you find in your recent actions you're finding more community in that same way as well?&nbsp; : Yeah, I do. I think that there is, as Amanda said, a yearning for a sense that we're not alone, that we are not a voice in the wilderness, that we have people around us. We have people who agree with us. And there's just huge strength in that\u2026. Someone once told me about what gorillas do when they're attacked, and they see a threat coming toward them and they go forward. But as they're going forward to meet the challenge, they're reaching out to make sure they're not alone. And I think that's what's happening here. We're each individually going forward, but we need to know that we're not alone \u2014 and we're not. I know that goodness will prevail. I know that decency will prevail. But we have to take chances. We have to speak out."

    "body": "Russia's airplanes and artillery widened their assault on Ukraine on Friday, striking airfields in the west and a major industrial hub in the east, as Moscow's forces tried to regroup from recent losses and their onslaught fast reduced crowded cities to rubble. American intelligence officials offered an assessment of the Russian air campaign, estimating that invading pilots are averaging 200 sorties a day, compared with five-to-10 for Ukrainian forces, which are focusing more on surface-to-air missiles, rocket-propelled grenades and drones to take out Russian aircraft. New commercial satellite images appeared to capture artillery firing on residential areas between Russian forces and the capital. The images from Maxar Technologies showed muzzle flashes and smoke from the big guns, as well as impact craters and burning homes in the town of Moschun, outside Kyiv, the company said. In a devastated village east of the capital, villagers climbed over toppled walls and flapping metal strips in the remnants of a pool hall, restaurant and theatre freshly blown apart by Russian bombs. Russian President Vladimir Putin \"created this mess, thinking he will be in charge here,\" 62-year-old Ivan Merzyk said. In temperatures sinking below freezing, villagers quickly spread plastic wrap or nailed plywood over blown out windows of their homes. \"We are not going away from here,\" Merzyk said. On the economic and political front,&nbsp;the U.S. and its allies moved to further isolate and sanction Russia. U.S. President Joe Biden announced the U.S. will dramatically downgrade its trade status with Russia and also ban imports of Russian seafood, alcohol and diamonds. The move to revoke Russia's \"most favoured nation\" status was taken in co-ordination with the European Union and G7 countries. \"The free world is coming together to confront Putin,\" Biden said. On the ground, Russian&nbsp;forces appeared to be trying to regroup and regain momentum after encountering heavier losses and stiffer resistance than anticipated&nbsp;over the past two weeks. Britain's Ministry of Defence said Russia is trying to \"reset and re-posture\" its troops, gearing up for operations against Kyiv. 'Going to get worse' \"It's ugly already, but it's going to get worse,\" said Nick Reynolds, a land warfare analyst at Royal United Services Institute, a British think-tank. , Russian President Vladimir Putin said there had&nbsp;been \"certain positive developments\" in Russia-Ukraine talks, but gave no details. For his part, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Ukrainian forces had \"reached a strategic turning point,\" though he did not elaborate. \"It's impossible to say how many days we will still need to free our land, but it is possible to say that we will do it,\" Zelensky said via video from Kyiv. Zelensky&nbsp;said authorities were working on establishing 12 humanitarian corridors and trying to ensure food, medicine and other basics get to people across the country.&nbsp;Thousands of civilians and soldiers are believed to have been killed in the invasion. He accused Russia of kidnapping the mayor of one city, Melitopol, calling the abduction \"a new stage of terror.\" The Biden administration had warned before the invasion of Russian plans to detain and kill targeted people in Ukraine. Zelensky&nbsp;himself is a likely top target. Biggest advances in east, south So far,&nbsp;the Russians have made the biggest advances on cities in the&nbsp;east and south while struggling in the north and around Kyiv. Russia said it used high-precision long-range weapons to put military airfields in Lutsk and Ivano-Frankivsk&nbsp;in the west \"out of action.\"&nbsp;The attack on Lutsk killed four Ukrainian servicemen, the city's mayor said. Russian airstrikes also targeted for the first time the eastern city of Dnipro, a major industrial hub in the east and Ukraine's fourth-largest city, with about one&nbsp;million people. One person was killed, Ukrainian officials said. In images of the aftermath released by Ukraine's emergency agency, firefighters doused a flaming building, and ash fell on bloodied rubble. Smoke billowed over shattered concrete where buildings once stood. The bombardment continued in Mariupol, where   sparked international outrage and war-crime allegations. No burials for Mariupol's&nbsp;dead Unrelenting attacks have thwarted repeated attempts to send in food and medicine and evacuate civilians from Mariupol, a city of 430,000. In a statement, the Mariupol mayor's office said Friday that the toll of people killed during the now 12-day siege had risen to 1,582. In the face of the unrelenting bombing, \"the dead aren't even being buried,\" the mayor's office said. Elsewhere, temperatures were forecast to hit -13 C in the eastern city of Kharkiv, which has come under heavy bombardment. About 400 apartment buildings in Kharkiv lost heat, and Mayor Ihor Terekhov appealed to remaining residents to descend into the subway or other underground shelters where blankets and hot food were being distributed. The latest assaults came a day after satellite photos appeared to show that the huge armoured column that was stalled for over a week outside Kyiv had spread out near the capital. Russian convoy fans out Military analysts were divided over whether the manoeuvring by the Russian convoy signalled the imminent start of a siege of Kyiv or was just an effort by the troops to disperse some vehicles to more protected positions. The photos showed howitzers newly set up in firing position, and armoured units staged near the Antonov Airport north of the city, according to Maxar. The 64-kilometre&nbsp;line of tanks and other vehicles had massed outside Kyiv early last week. Its advance appeared to stop&nbsp;amid reports of food and fuel shortages, muddy roads and attacks by Ukrainian troops with anti-tank missiles. Mathieu Boulegue, a researcher at the London think-tank Chatham House, said the redeployment means the battle for Kyiv is just hours or days away. He predicted a drawn-out siege. \"This is going to be a very long battle of attrition. This is going to be an atrociously casualty-heavy battle and a siege, the likes of which we have rarely seen in modern history,\" Boulegue said. U.S. officials saw the breakup of the convoy headed toward Kyiv as less significant.&nbsp; A U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to describe the U.S. military assessment, said that the convoy had not made any substantial progress toward the city and that the vehicles' moves are not part of a tactical effort to advance on Kyiv. The U.S. also says Russia has launched nearly 810 missiles into Ukraine. Meanwhile, the United Nations political chief said the international organization had received credible reports that Russian forces were using cluster bombs in populated areas. The bombs scatter smaller explosives over a wide area and are prohibited in cities and towns under international law. Repeated rounds of negotiations between Russia and Ukraine have taken place along the Belarus border, and the two countries' foreign ministers held talks on Thursday with no apparent progress, while various third countries have also made attempts to broker a stop to the fighting. Appeal for help with 'migration crisis' Some 2.5 million people have fled Ukraine since the invasion began, the International Organization for Migration said Friday, with more than half of those going to Poland. Warsaw's mayor is appealing for international help as the city becomes overwhelmed by refugees, with more than a tenth of all those fleeing the war in Ukraine arriving in the Polish capital. \"We are dealing with the greatest migration crisis in the history of Europe since World War II \u2026 The situation is getting more and more difficult every day,\" Mayor Rafal Trzaskowski said, adding that \"the greatest challenge is still ahead of us.\" The International Monetary Fund said it will increase financial support to Moldova to help it withstand the extra pressure created by the arrival of over 270,000 refugees from Ukraine, the agency said Friday. Around 105,000 of those refugees have stayed in Moldova, according to government figures from Thursday. The southeastern European country of Romania, a nation of about 19 million residents, had taken in more than 84,000 displaced people as of Tuesday, according to United Nations data. Other countries on NATO's eastern flank, including Hungary, Moldova and Slovakia, have also welcomed tens of thousands of refugees. In Berlin, Interior Ministry spokesperson Marek Wede said Friday that federal police so far have recorded 109,183 people coming from Ukraine entering the country, more than 99,000 of them Ukrainian citizens. He noted that the number may be higher because Germany doesn't have full regular border checks on its eastern frontiers with Poland and the Czech Republic. Just over the Ukraine border into Slovakia, CBC News spoke to tired Ukrainians who have fled. A woman named Tanya said her plan was to make her way to Warsaw, where she has heard there is a school that teaches blind children like her 10-year-old daughter Veronika. \"I just don't know how to get there from here,\" she said."

    "body": "With four films up for best picture, four series nominated for the top television awards and 34 total nominations, Netflix dominated the 77th Golden Globe nominations announced&nbsp;Monday. Noah Baumbach's divorce portrait  &nbsp;led all films with six nominations, including for best picture, drama&nbsp;and acting nods for its two leads, Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson, as announced by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association in Beverly Hills, Calif. ,&nbsp;which landed on Netflix on Friday after a three-week run in cinemas, also earned nods for Baumbach's script, Laura Dern's supporting performance and Randy Newman's score. The only notable category it missed&nbsp;was Baumbach for best director. Three other Netflix films landed best picture nods, chief among them Martin Scorsese's mob epic  ,&nbsp;which landed five nominations, including for best drama picture, best director for Scorsese, and supporting acting nods for Al Pacino and Joe Pesci. Surprisingly left out was its lead, Robert De Niro.                                                                                                Canadian filmmaker Dean DeBlois of Aylmer, Que., wrote and directed  , the final instalment in the Oscar-nominated animated film trilogy. Montreal-raised actor Jay Baruchel voices the lead character, a young Viking named Hiccup. Streaming projects on top Quentin Tarantino's 1960s Los Angeles fable  &nbsp;also scored five nominations, including for best film comedy or musical, and nods for actors Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio. Tarantino is also up for best director.                        But Netflix flexed its muscles across all categories, just as it is girding for battle with a host of new streaming services. Two other films garnered best picture nods: the Vatican bromance  &nbsp;in the drama category (along with nominations for stars, Jonathan Pryce and Anthony Hopkins), and the Eddie Murphy-led  &nbsp;in the comedy category (along with an acting nod for Murphy). Two Netflix series tied HBO's  &nbsp;with the most nominations on the TV side:  &nbsp;and  .&nbsp;All scored four nods. Netflix's  &nbsp;and  &nbsp;also landed best series, comedy or musical, nominations alongside Emmy favourites  ,&nbsp;from Amazon, and HBO's  . Led by  ,&nbsp; &nbsp;and  ,&nbsp;HBO still had a strong showing with 15 nods overall, second to Netflix's 17 television nominations, even if the final season of  &nbsp;missed a best drama series nod.                                                                      But streaming services made greater inroads to one of Hollywood's biggest parties than ever before. Amazon had 8 nominations in total, boosted by  &nbsp;and  .&nbsp; The recently launched Apple TV Plus scored its first Globes nominations with  ,&nbsp;including nods for Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon. Acting nominees include:&nbsp;                                                                                                                    &nbsp;                                                                                                                                                                  In the early going, Netflix has dominated awards season.  &nbsp;last week won best film from the New York Film Critics Circle and the National Board of Review.  &nbsp;virtually swept the IFP Gotham Awards. The Globes, with 87 voting members, differ wildly from the Academy Awards, which are decided by 9,000 industry professionals. But the press association's choices sometimes line up with the academy's, like last year when  &nbsp;(entered as a comedy at the Globes) triumphed at both. This year could give the Globes slightly more sway because the awards season is especially truncated. The Academy Awards are being held several weeks early, on Feb. 9, giving Oscar campaigns less time to find momentum. But several possible Academy Awards favourites weren't even eligible in the Globes' top categories. Even though the press association is a group of foreign journalists based in Los Angeles, they don't nominate international films for best drama or best comedy/musical.

    "body": "For Duncan Kenyon, the implicit criticism frequently comes in the form of a question.&nbsp; Despite years spent developing sustainable energy projects, the Alberta regional director of the Pembina Institute still gets asked how he heats his home or if he drove to a meeting.&nbsp;&nbsp; It's the go-to criticism incessantly spat at environmentalists:&nbsp;if you produce even a modicum of greenhouse gases,&nbsp;you can't say anything about climate change. And this criticism stings. \"It makes me feel shitty, and I do everything I can,\" says Kenyon.&nbsp; That's the burn of being branded an environmental hypocrite. And then there's the scorched-earth fire environmentalist Greta Thunberg's   drew. The 16-year-old Swedish activist attracted both a crowd of thousands to the provincial legislature in October to join her weekly climate strike, and an explosion of scornful taunts of duplicity and pretence.&nbsp;&nbsp;        Despite using an electric-powered Tesla vehicle to travel around Alberta, Thunberg was called out for  . And critics branded the young demonstrators, who joined her climate strike in Edmonton, hypocrites on Twitter, chastising them for using buses to get to the event.&nbsp; Even Alberta Premier Jason Kenney,   a $200-million pipeline delivering gas to two of Alberta's largest power plants on the same day protestors took to the streets of the oil-rich province's capital, couldn't resist taunting the demonstrators, wondering how they \"charged their iPhones.\"&nbsp; \"When they power up the speakers at the Legislature today,\" added Kenney outside Pioneer Pipeline, 70 kilometres west of Edmonton, \"the power \u2026 came from power generated at power plants like this.\"&nbsp; But is this really hypocrisy? Philosophers doubt it, calling the criticism a   that shuts down a crucial debate about climate change. Besides, what's wrong with being a hypocrite? It may, indeed, be hypocritical to protest oil extraction while also using fossil fuels to power up speakers at a climate change demonstration \u2014&nbsp;but maybe that's the point. People who want to change society also live in it.&nbsp; In the art of argument, a   doesn't logically flow from the statement that came before it. It's a bad argument. The hypocrisy criticism thrown at climate activists is also an   or personal attack because it's directed at the environmentalist (the person) and not their argument about reducing greenhouse gases. \"The point of making that argument,\" says Mount Royal University philosopher Sinc MacRae, \"is to label somebody a hypocrite and somehow denigrate them.\" MacRae points to the anti-apartheid leader Nelson Mandela. Mandela, stresses MacRae, was highly critical of politicians&nbsp;\u2014&nbsp;but he became a politician, himself, serving as South Africa's first black head of state.&nbsp; Was Mandela a hypocrite? Sure, but becoming a politician allowed Mandela to dismantle the legacy of apartheid. Many credit the former African National Congress head's skilled leadership with preventing a civil war and fostering reconciliation in post-apartheid&nbsp; South Africa. \"In order to justify the charge of hypocrisy ... you have to show a connection between what [the so-called hypocrite says] or what they do,\" says MacRae, \"and it being a bad thing.\" Branding climate activists hypocrites for wanting to decrease fossil fuel consumption while at the same time burning them is, therefore, a logical fallacy. Abolitionists who opposed slavery in the United States, for instance, wore clothes that were spun from the cotton harvested by slaves. \"But that did not make them hypocrites,\" Harvard historian Naomi Oreskes   in 2015. \"It just meant that they were also part of the slave economy, and they knew it. That is why they acted to change the  , not just their clothes.\" The hypocrite argument also falls apart because it ignores big structural factors.&nbsp; Sure, some people do live  , or walk and ride their bikes everywhere.&nbsp;But, for most of us, it's nearly impossible to escape creating greenhouse gases.&nbsp;&nbsp; Fossil fuels don't just heat our homes and fuel our vehicles, they are also the foundation of almost everything from electronics to painkillers. \"Our whole society is structured around fossil fuels,\" says Duncan Kenyon of the Pembina Institute. \"It's the backbone of our society, our economy.\" It's, therefore, nonsensical to suggest that having a carbon footprint means you can't legitimately raise concerns about climate change and its potentially&nbsp; . Protestors demonstrating cuts to the health-care system wouldn't likely forgo lifesaving treatment at a hospital if they needed it. Similarly, you can be a capitalist and critique the free-market system. You can work in the oil and gas industry and recycle. In fact, people who work in the energy industry have done a lot to  .&nbsp;&nbsp; Climate change activists don't deny they use fossil fuels. They just want to stop or limit their use of them. Plus, individual action won't be enough to address climate change.&nbsp; Despite its flawed logic, the hypocrite criticism gets repeated over and over again.&nbsp;It's become the go-to line for ending discussion about climate change. And maybe that's the point. Asking environmentalists how they charge their iPhone or if they drove to a protest is really aimed at shutting down debate. Calling someone a hypocrite usually ends a conversation fast. And there's power in that. Silence is strategic. These personal attacks lower the quality of our political and economic discourse, says&nbsp;MacRae. \"It leaves only two choices,\" he adds. \"Either you're perfect \u2026 or you're evil and you're a complete, complete failure.\" And if you're a failure, you're deemed a phony whose concerns about climate change aren't valid. Kenyon says politicians such as Jason Kenney are really using the hypocrite critique to discredit climate change activists and shut them up. It's much easier, after all, to not talk about complex issues&nbsp;than to tackle them.&nbsp; It's a powerful trick politicians use to discount environmentalists because they are \"talking out of both sides of their mouth,\" says Kenyon. \"It's actually a way of shutting down discourse or discussion.\" Some environmentalists, however, wear the scarlet letter of hypocrite like a badge of honour. Like minority groups who have reclaimed derogatory terms used to vilify them, some environmentalists embrace the label of hypocrisy. After all, recognizing the inescapable nature of fossil fuels is kind of the point. \"No one can live a non-hypocritical lifestyle in a meaningful way,\" says Adam Kingsmith,  , who highlights his hypocrisy in order to&nbsp; spark change. Kingsmith says he's forced to consume fossil fuels. It's unavoidable. The doctoral student with York University's political science department remembers being called a hypocrite while at an environmental protest in Vancouver. Of course he is, he concedes. Instead of a bad thing, Kingsmith argues that hypocrisy actually highlights how central fossil fuels are to our lives. Even people such as Kingsmith, who want to reduce their carbon footprint, must use fossil fuels.&nbsp; \"We have to be hypocrites to exist,\"&nbsp;he says. \"Hypocrisy is based on the kind of idea that there's \u2026 a choice to not be hypocritical,\" he adds. \"And I think that sort of choice doesn't really exist. And I think if we had more frank conversation around the fact that ... to be hypocritical or not hypocritical is really a non-choice.\" Instead of hypocrisy being a criticism, it should be an important launching pad for conversations about addressing climate change and our reliance on fossil fuels, argues Kingsmith. And a big part of that conversation could play out in the news media.&nbsp; Deceit, duplicity, deception. Hypocrisy is a hallmark of stories in the news. But should the news media highlight the carbon footprint hypocrisy of environmentalists? Sean Holman, a professor of journalism at Mount Royal University, thinks journalists need to be careful when shining a light on hypocrisy in this way. Holman, who recently wrote   to start reporting on climate change as an emergency, calls the hypocrisy criticism directed at environmentalists who use buses to get to protests, for example, a \"specious argument.\" \"The perfect,\" he stresses, \"should not be the enemy of the good.\" \"Pillorying people who can't be perfect because the world doesn't allow them to be perfect is not the approach [the news media] should be taking.\" Holman says it's fair game for the news media to call out environmentalists who take private jets or yachts to get to climate summits. But it's another thing to echo and amplify the hypocrisy criticism when politicians such as Jason Kenney use it to question the validity of climate change protesters because they dare to charge their mobile phones. \"It's being used as a weapon to attack those people who are taking action on the most important issue of our time,\" says Holman.&nbsp;\"And that does not seem to be a particularly honourable political tactic nor does it seem to be a particularly honest political tactic.\" And such criticism can poison the water, polarizing the debate about climate change.&nbsp; No doubt, many of the people criticizing environmentalists feel threatened.&nbsp;Alberta's stubbornly sluggish economy has many worried about their livelihood and future. A convoy of counter-protesters made its way from Red Deer to the legislature at the same time as Thunberg,   they are \"tired of celebrities coming into our province and trying to tell us how to run our oil and gas sector.\"&nbsp; The convoy crowd feels threatened.&nbsp;&nbsp; And climate change activists feel the planet is in danger. There is no consensus about what comes next. The old ways are threatened and the new way is opaque, sparking this nasty clash. Kenyon, with the Pembina Institute, argues the new way for Alberta is a low-carbon future. He says the province needs to do much more to prepare for an economy with much less fossil fuel&nbsp;at its centre.&nbsp;&nbsp; And part of getting there will involve changing attitudes. He stresses that the   across the country about climate change shouldn't be seen by Albertans as an attack on them. The hypocrite criticism, warns Kenyon, could also erode the goodwill of the many Canadians who currently consume Alberta's oil and gas but want to reduce their use. He predicts those people would switch to renewable alternatives now if they could. \"If I was an oil executive or the premier of a province [such as Alberta] relying on oil products ... I would be quite worried about that,\" he says, especially with more and more green energy sources becoming available. The more you criticize people, cautions Kenyon, the happier they'll be to switch to renewable energy.                   "

    "body": "For years, The Old School Community Gathering Place Co-operative has been working to produce drinking water from an aquifer beneath Musquodoboit Harbour, N.S.&nbsp; In April, a grand opening was held for a solar-powered community well that tapped into the water supply, but no residents have been able to fill up since.&nbsp; \"As it turned out, the draw on the well from one solar panel was not enough&nbsp;and so we had to get another one,\" said Karen Bradley, past chair of the non-profit co-operative's board. \"And that led to needing more inverters and more batteries and so on and so forth. So it just sort of grew all the way through the entire summer.\" Bradley said the drilled well is expected to be operational in the spring. The&nbsp;building, which houses the pump, batteries and distribution tap, is not winterized.&nbsp; \"It was never meant to be year-round. It's not community water in the sense that you would expect from a utility,\" she said.&nbsp; Bradley said when it's operating, community members will be able fill up personal bottles from spring to fall&nbsp;\u2014&nbsp;particularly valuable when private wells run dry.&nbsp; 'Extremely dry fall'&nbsp; Trevor Hadwen, with Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, said there has been continued dryness in summer, and even more intense conditions in the fall. He said the province is experiencing moderate drought, but anticipates data will show severe conditions in November.&nbsp; \"It's fairly abnormal to have these kinds of drought conditions in the fall period,\" said Hadwen. Hadwen said higher-than-average temperatures have also contributed to drought.&nbsp; On Tuesday, Halifax Water&nbsp;introduced&nbsp;mandatory restrictions on some activities for customers&nbsp;who are supplied by the Lake Major reservoir.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Municipality of Barrington&nbsp;has also experienced several droughts since 2016. Plans for a desalination&nbsp;device, in partnership with a Quebec company,&nbsp;did not go ahead in the summer.&nbsp;&nbsp; Barret Kurylyk, an associate professor of civil engineering at Dalhousie University, said&nbsp;drought is becoming more common in Nova Scotia where 40 per cent of households rely on private wells. \"So it's something we have to be thinking about long term as a province, as municipalities and as homeowners,\" he said&nbsp; Kurylyk said the cost of piping water directly to homes causes resistance among residents in rural villages.&nbsp; \"But one of the first steps can be just these centralized water units that don't distribute water to every household, but are just like a pump and fill station for or when you have times of drought and there's no water in your own well,\" he said.&nbsp; Bruce Manion, who lives in Ostrea Lake, said many residents were opposed to the cost of piped water found in previous studies commissioned by the Halifax Regional Municipality. He said some have also taken to social media to press the co-operative for answers on the well, which was funded by taxpayers.&nbsp; Thousands spent&nbsp; \"I've deemed this project to be what I call a vanity project,\" said Manion. \"They wanted to see this happen \u2026 But it's not necessarily good public policy.\"&nbsp; In 2021, the well project&nbsp;received $14,500 from Farm Credit Canada&nbsp;through the Crown corporation's AgriSpirit fund. It has also received $9,000 of municipal tax dollars that are collected through the area rate, according to Bradley.&nbsp; \"I just wish that people in the community would be interested in participating in these processes and understanding some of the frustrations that we've all had in trying to bring this project to complete fruition for everybody's benefit,\" she said.&nbsp; Manion said that is something he has tried to do \u2014 without success&nbsp;\u2014&nbsp;in order to help the project, which also promised water during&nbsp;extended power outages.&nbsp; \"Our biggest time for power outages around here is winter,\" he said. \"So the fact that, you know, part of this grandiose project was to provide water in emergency situations, it won't happen.\"&nbsp; The&nbsp;Old School Community Gathering Place Co-operative says on its website that its mission is to \"foster a&nbsp;vibrant inclusive community\" through&nbsp;\"services that promote the health, well-being, and community spirit of all people in Musquodoboit Harbour and surrounding areas.\" \"The well was merely a proof-of-concept project. It was hardly a vanity project \u2014 anyone with any vanity would have given up during the battles with HRM and believe me, giving up would have made my life far better,\" Bradley said in a statement to CBC News on Friday.&nbsp;"

    "body": "Brick Lane has long been a must-see tourist site in London's east end, harbouring boutiques, restaurants and the city's thriving street art scene.&nbsp; But as the Brexit deadline looms, new murals and paste-ups appear on its walls daily&nbsp;\u2014&nbsp;and it's incubating discussion about the U.K.'s escalating political climate.&nbsp; Other artists and passersby leave comments on the pieces to share their perspectives, or tear them off in defiance. The public interacts with the art by \"augmenting and changing it,\" said Dave Stuart, founder of Shoreditch Street Art Tours, who has been leading groups through the area for the past 15 years. When it came to Brexit, he said, \"the handbrake came off and [artists] did loads of political street art.\"&nbsp; Stuart says he hasn't seen any pro-Brexit work along Brick Lane, though there are some pro-Brexit responses to the anti-Brexit pieces. A lot of the anti-Brexit street art only started appearing in March 2019, when the initial date to leave the EU was approaching, he said. The U.K. has gone through three prime ministers in three years and the turmoil of uncertainty over a no-deal Brexit has caused   and  repercussions. The current deadline to reach a separation agreement with the EU is set for Oct. 31. Given London's largely \"remain\" voting population, Stuart said it made sense that most artists working in Brick Lane are anti-Brexit.&nbsp; \"Maybe [street artists] didn't engage in it sufficiently because Brexit didn't seem to be probable to them,\" he said, adding that a lot of the Brexit-related art \"came down the mine after the event, when it was too late.\" Most of the street art depicts pro-Brexit British Prime Minister Boris Johnson in comic roles, such as a clown. \"It was soul-destroying when that happened,\" street artist Uberfubs said of the 2016 Brexit vote. \"I was in an incredibly low place for weeks and months after. It was a total shock.\" Uberfubs, who declined to provide her real name because some of her work is on private property without permission, is Irish, but she also holds Canadian nationality through her father.&nbsp; \"I'd grown up believing that London was cosmopolitan, it was multiracial and full of immigrants,'' she said. \"I had to question what my immigration status was.\" Though being a street artist is something Uberfubs does on the side, she spends hours lino-printing skulls on tissue, foil and plastic, embellishing them by hand to add texture. The words \"Scrap Brexit\" are printed on some of her recent paste-ups. Uberfubs started to put up her art in 2017, because she felt \"frustrated\" about the results of the referendum. \"Doing street art was a chance to get my voice not heard but seen,\" she said. She also regularly protests outside the U.K. Parliament in the evenings. For Subdude, another artist who wanted to stay anonymous for the same reason as Uberfubs, street art is an expression of protest which helps him deal with the anger of Brexit and other aspects of global politics.&nbsp; He does meme-style paste-ups of political leaders like Boris Johnson and pairs them with puns, like \"Bojo the bozo.\" During a stroll through Brick Lane, the self-taught artist pointed out some of his old pieces that had been defaced and scratched off. But he wasn't bothered by it. \"It's a sign that the art works and the art has provoked something,\" he said. \"To me, it's getting a reaction \u2014 and a lot of the time, the reaction is bad or destructive.\" \"It's hard to avoid the subject, especially as artists. Every piece of art is viewed with a Brexit lens at the minute and that's really sad,\" said Jason Gale, of Quiet&nbsp;British Accent, who does penny art with his wife, Sharon. After the referendum, they started leaving pennies on the streets for people to find. Some of the pennies had phrases painted on them: \"Quiet But Angry,\" \"Quite Bloody Angry\" and \"Quash Boris's Ass\" \u2014 all a play on the duo's acronym, QBA. The couple said they painted on out-of-use British pennies because they hold a sense of democracy, history, value and change \u2014 all of which can be viewed politically. The Gales ships their art around Europe and the world; with a no-deal Brexit on the horizon, they fear shipping taxes will impact their business.&nbsp; Both come from artistic backgrounds but they only started working together after their youngest child started secondary school eight years ago. \"Our kids are now old enough to vote, and they're really angry,\" said Jason."

    "body": "Polish opposition leader Donald Tusk declared the beginning of a new era for his country after opposition parties appeared to have won enough votes in Sunday's election to oust the governing nationalist conservative party. That party, Law and Justice, has bickered with allies and faced accusations of eroding rule of law at home in its eight years in power. It appeared that voters were mobilized like never before, voting in even greater numbers than when the nation ousted the communist authorities in 1989. If the result predicted by an exit poll holds, Law and Justice won but also lost. It got more seats than any other party but not enough to be&nbsp;able to lead a government that can pass pass laws in the legislature. The Ipsos exit poll suggested that Law and Justice obtained 200 seats. The far-right Confederation got 12 seats, a showing the party acknowledged was a defeat. It also showed that three opposition parties have likely won a combined 248 seats in the 460-seat lower house of parliament, the Sejm. The largest of the groups is Civic Coalition, led by Tusk, a former prime minister and former European Union president. \"I have been a politician for many years. I'm an athlete. Never in my life have I been so happy about taking seemingly second place. Poland won. Democracy has won. We have removed them from power,\" Tusk told his cheering supporters. \"This result might still be better, but already today we can say this is the end of the bad time, this is end of Law and Justice rule,\" Tusk added. Law and Justice leader Jaroslaw Kaczynski acknowledged the ambiguous result. He told supporters at his headquarters that his party's result, at nearly 37 per cent&nbsp;of the vote, according to the exit poll, was a success, making it the party to win the most votes for three parliamentary elections in a row. \"We must have hope and we must also know that regardless of whether we are in power or in the opposition, we will implement this [political]&nbsp;project in various ways and we will not allow Poland to be betrayed,\" Kaczynski said. If the result holds, and Law and Justice is the single party with the most seats, then it would get the first chance to try to build a government. It falls to President Andrzej Duda, who is an ally of Law and Justice, to tap a party to try to form a government. Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said on Polsat News that Duda \"will entrust the mission of forming the government to the winning party and in this first step we will certainly try to build a parliamentary majority.\" Three opposition parties, Tusk's Civic Coalition, Third Way and the New Left, ran on separate tickets but with the same promises of seeking to oust Law and Justice and restore good ties with the European Union. Wlodzimierz Czarzasty, a leader of the Left party, vowed to work with the others to \"create a democratic, strong, reasonable and predictable government.\" Katarzyna Pelczynska-Nalecz, the head of election campaign for Third Way, called it a \"huge day for our democracy.\" \"We are very satisfied and full of hope that things will be much better in Poland in the days, months and years to come,\" she said. Votes were still being counted and the state electoral commission says it expects to have final results by Tuesday morning. LGBT rights, Ukraine and abortion key issues At stake are the health of the nation's constitutional order, its legal stance on LGBTQ+ rights and abortion, and the foreign alliances of a country that has been a crucial ally to Ukraine after Russia launched its full-scale invasion. LGBTQ+ rights activist Bart Staszewski called it the end of a \"nightmare\" for himself as a gay man and others. \"This is just the beginning of reclaiming of our country. The fight is ahead but we are breathing fresh air today,\" Staszewski said. Environmental activist Dominika Lasota was emotional with relief, saying \"we have our future.\" Law and Justice has eroded checks and balances to gain more control over state institutions, including the courts, public media and the electoral process itself. During the campaign many Poles described the vote as the most important one since 1989, when a new democracy was born after decades of communism. Turnout Sunday appeared to be even higher than the 63 per cent of voters who turned out for a 1989 election that led to the ouster of the communists. \"It seems that we have broken a record,\" said Sylwester Marciniak, the head of the state electoral commission. Despite many uncertainties ahead, what appeared certain was that support for the ruling party has shrunk since the last election in 2019 when it won nearly 44 per cent&nbsp;of the vote, its popularity dented by high inflation, allegations of cronyism and bickering with European allies. If the result holds, it marks a sharp defeat for a ruling party that adopted divisive policies at home, often pushing laws through without trying to build consensus. Others saw economic threats in the way the party has governed and believe that high social spending has helped to fuel inflation. There is also a high level of state ownership in the Polish economy, and the governing party has built up a system of patronage, handing out thousands of jobs and contracts to its loyalists. A political change could open the way for the EU to release billions of euros in funding that has been withheld over what the EU viewed as democratic erosion. The fate of Poland's relationship with Ukraine was also at stake. The Confederation party campaigned on an anti-Ukraine message, accusing the country of lacking gratitude to Poland for its help in Russia's war. Its poor showing will be a relief for Kyiv. Around 29 million Poles from age 18 were eligible to vote. They chose 460 members of the lower house, or Sejm, and 100 for the Senate for four-year terms. A referendum on migration, the retirement age and other issues was held simultaneously. Some government opponents called on voters to boycott the referendum. More than 31,000 voting stations operated across Poland, while there were more than 400 voting stations abroad. In a sign of the emotions generated by the vote, more than 600,000 Poles registered to vote abroad. Individual parties need to get at least five&nbsp;per cent&nbsp;of votes to win seats in parliament, while coalitions need at least eight per cent&nbsp;of votes."

    "body": "They survived such catastrophic events as the Spanish flu, two world wars and the Great Depression. How are some of Ottawa's most venerable businesses coping through the coronavirus pandemic? CBC&nbsp;reached out to ask how they're doing. Ch\u00e2teau Lafayette, Est. 1849 General manager Deek&nbsp;Labelle gave birth in mid-March&nbsp;and is safe at home with little Nathan&nbsp;while her ByWard Market baby, the Ch\u00e2teau Lafayette, remains closed. \"The Laff,\" billed as Ottawa's oldest tavern, dates back to 1849, and is&nbsp;very much&nbsp;still alive and kicking. \"It's hard to believe. The fact that it's still here and still surviving and thriving speaks volumes,\" Labelle&nbsp;said. \"I don't want to jinx it.\" There have been hard times, she said, but nothing quite like this. \"This is the hardest one we've ever endured. The smoking bylaw would be the closest second to it, for the severity of an overnight change.\"&nbsp; To survive Ottawa's smoking crackdown, the venerable watering hole was severed in two, with half becoming a Quiznos franchise so the remaining bar could sustain itself. Unlike other establishments, The Laff hasn't stayed open for takeout or delivery during the pandemic. \"The bar is the experience. You can't take that out,\" Labelle observed. Labelle&nbsp;hopes to reopen this summer and is considering applying for a larger patio so customers, when they return, can spread out and enjoy themselves like old times. \"We just want to see our regulars again, our friends. These are people we see weekly, if not daily.\" Marchand Electric, Est. 1892 Jacques Marchand can trace his family's lighting and electrical business back three generations.&nbsp; \"My father's father's father,\" Marchand&nbsp;noted proudly. He's the fourth. Founded just 14 years after&nbsp;Thomas Edison unveiled the first practical incandescent light bulb, Marchand Electric has seen its share of history. Now, the company is trying to survive COVID-19. \"We have experience with slowdowns before, and the trick \u2026 is to react quickly. You have to look at your costs and your staff. We had to lay some people off, unfortunately,\" Marchand said. A skeleton staff&nbsp;continues&nbsp;to work at the Algoma&nbsp;Road&nbsp;location. Retail sales have been limited to online purchases, but the store has been deemed&nbsp;an essential service because they&nbsp;supply to hospitals. There are already signs things are picking up:&nbsp;Marchand has recalled three of the six people he laid off.&nbsp; \"So we got the guys back working in the warehouse. They're also working on inventories and painting floors. Make-work projects.&nbsp;You have to retain these employees,\" he said. Marchand is also trying to convince clients to plan \u2014 &nbsp;and order \u2014 ahead. \"You've got a project coming up? Why don't we talk about it now instead of freaking out at the last minute, two months from now?\" ER Fisher Menswear, Est. 1905 Sonia Fisher is a fourth-generation purveyor of quality men's clothing, a retail business established by her great-grandfather, Emerson Ralph Fisher, 115 years ago.&nbsp; It was ER Fisher who got the company through the Depression years. Part of company lore is that&nbsp;\"he did not lay off a single person,\" Sonia Fisher noted. Back then, the company reduced its hours, but stayed open. With COVID-19, things are different. Forced to close the Westboro store, Fisher has had to lay off 12 employees. \"I didn't want to get the business in a situation where we were worse off five to six months down the road,\" she said. Most spring merchandise had already been delivered, but \"anything that hadn't arrived, we cancelled,\" Fisher said.&nbsp;They're already trimming back on their fall orders. \"It'll take time for people to develop confidence again in the economy,\" Fisher said, \"so we are predicting a drop in sales over the next year.\" Unlike other retailers, ER Fisher doesn't&nbsp;sell online. Personalized service has always been its brand. Now, Fisher admits it might be time to update that business model. \"It's definitely something that we're going to be ramping up.&nbsp;It's a sore spot for me because I worry that I should have done it a little sooner.\" McIntosh and Watts, Est. 1906 McIntosh and Watts started out as a coffee and tea emporium, with deliveries made by horse and buggy. &nbsp; \"We could have been Starbucks,\" jokes the company's fourth-generation president, Peter McIntosh, who's been selling&nbsp;china and tableware for 35 years. His grandfather, Grant McIntosh, was stationed in England&nbsp;during the Second World War and made connections at factories that made fine bone china, which he began exporting to Canada, far away from German bombs. \"They adapted. They did everything they could to continue to function,\" McIntosh&nbsp;said. \"That's how you have to survive.\"&nbsp; Fast-forward to 2020.&nbsp;The store on Industrial Avenue&nbsp;has been closed since mid-March, the company's online&nbsp;and wholesale business now operating out of McIntosh's home.&nbsp; \"We're adapting. We're working hard on the parts of our business we can continue to develop. We've just scaled everything back,\" McIntosh said. Frisby Tire, Est. 1920 \"Frisby the Vulcanizer\"&nbsp;was established by Don Frisby's great-uncle, George Frisby, upon his discharge after the First World War.&nbsp; The company survived the Great Depression, but Don Frisby&nbsp;said he never heard the stories about how they managed.&nbsp; \"They were ... men of very few words. All those guys did was work.\" Deemed essential, the business&nbsp;has been&nbsp;allowed to stay open, but retail customers have been staying away and business is down 30 per cent. It's been a \"double whammy,\" Frisby said, arriving at what's normally one of his busiest seasons. He's responded by resetting his expectations. \"My goal all along has been to keep as many people working as possible and to stay open and forget about being profitable. We just want to be able to keep functioning as a business,\" Frisby said. Of his 100 employees, just one has had a layoff notice. \"Our on-the-road salesperson, whom nobody wants to see. Poor guy,\" Frisby said. So why not let a few more go until this thing blows over? \"Right from my great-uncle and my father and through to me, we've always understood ... that our customers and the people who look after our customers are the most important aspect of the business,\" Frisby said."

We received   as well as on the  . Here's a sampling.&nbsp; Kent Dunville&nbsp;in North Granville built a treehouse for the kids, mostly from&nbsp;recycled items.&nbsp; \"Floors and frame are pallets, siding from friend, the fibreglass roof is a huge '80s satellite dish and even stuff from roadside cleanups like railings and windows,\" he said.&nbsp; Dunville said aside from going to work, the family stayed home all summer, so had time and energy for the project. \"We really had more time not running here and there for kids and pointless errands,&nbsp;we just stayed close to home and did stuff at home and made our own projects to do with kids,\" he said, adding he loves to teach his kids to build things.&nbsp; Melissa Gray said during the summer of 2020 she had plenty of time to paint her mother's house, changing it from barn red to aqua. \"Chef Michael Smith even stopped and told her it looks like a cosy sweater now,\" Gray said. \"We were both out of work for a few months, we were already planning on painting it, but it definitely wouldn't have been done so fast if not for the pandemic.\"&nbsp; Chris Knox owns production company K-Audio, and his work was curtailed as performances and gatherings were cancelled. He took the time to build&nbsp;an enclosed,&nbsp;elevated woodworking workshop in his warehouse with its own electrical panel, dust collection and flip-top workbenches. \"I've put off my custom drum building for the last six/seven years&nbsp;to build up my production company, but now that COVID has put a stop to all concerts and festivals, I plan on stepping up the drum building again,\" Knox said.&nbsp; Heather Mullen of Mount Stewart said her family enclosed part of their deck to create a sun porch. \"We started the project in the spring after we had spent chilly days and evenings on the deck,\" Mullen wrote.&nbsp;\"This room provides a space outside of the main living area to read and play music and attend many virtual meetings.\" Anna Keenan and her husband did some kitchen upgrades at their St. Ann&nbsp;home including a sunny yellow tile backsplash, new windows and new countertops,&nbsp;a DIY renovation they'd&nbsp;started in 2017 when they&nbsp;bought their 120-year-old farmhouse. \"We know that we are lucky to have not had our jobs at risk when the shutdowns happened,\" because she already worked from home before COVID-19 hit, Keenan said. But the couple and their young child&nbsp;did have more time and money during the pandemic since bubbling under the same roof with a friend and her child&nbsp;\u2014 CBC P.E.I.  . \"With evening and weekend dance classes, public events, leisure activities cancelled, it made it easy to chip away at these long-neglected tasks,\" Keenan commented.&nbsp; Next to the kitchen, the bathroom is another shared family space that saw more use with people at home during the pandemic, and it's the room Donovan McNeely's family had&nbsp;redone this summer. \"It was the last room in the house to renovate and was one of the most expensive projects,\" he shared. \"We have been waiting a long time to finally get this done! \"It made it much easier to afford since we were working from home. We are rural so it saves a substantial amount on gas with two&nbsp;of us not driving back and forth every day.\" He said it did take a few months between booking the contractor and getting the work done.&nbsp; Lori S. MacArthur of Charlottetown has almost completed the reno on&nbsp;her family's bathroom, which dates back to&nbsp;the 1970s.&nbsp; \"Because we will not be travelling this year, probably not for a long time, [this was] a good way to keep busy and put our money to good use,\" MacArthur said.&nbsp; \"We both have said this has been a good lesson as far as enjoying home more.\" Audrey Gee Arsenault of Wellington used a washed-grey click flooring to create an accent wall in her kitchen, covering up dated red paint.&nbsp;&nbsp; She said with extracurricular&nbsp;activities&nbsp;cancelled due to COVID-19,&nbsp;her family&nbsp;went on fewer outings and&nbsp;restaurant visits. \"We had more cash to spend on renovations and best of all, we had more time to focus on our home. Since we were/are spending more time at home with family, we want to slowly improve it so it becomes more of a cosy and&nbsp;clean sanctuary,\" she said. Many people made improvements to their backyards, like Chelsea Murphy, who built a fire pit and some lounging chairs. \"I was off work because the kids were out of school/daycare. We got to spend more time outside, so why not make the yard a better space?\" she said. \"As for spending, I was saving lots of money on daycare, so we put it to good use. Like fixing up the yard and buying lots of treats.\" More from CBC P.E.I."

    "body": "Former employees and clients of Addiction Recovery Network are calling on the Ontario government to regulate private addiction treatment centres after raising concerns about the quality of services provided to clients by the Greater Toronto Area company. Both the parent of a client, and a former addictions counsellor told CBC News they didn't think that clients were receiving the treatment they paid for because of a high turnover in employees who quit after not getting paid.&nbsp; Addiction Recovery Network (ARN) owes former employees nearly $97,000 in unpaid wages, according to the Ministry of Labour. &nbsp; The company's owner John Haines says he intends to pay the wages, and denies there are any problems with the treatment provided by his facilities.&nbsp; Debbie Beaton says her son went through four different addiction counsellors over the course of the 20 days he spent in a six-week treatment program at the company's Brampton facility this spring at&nbsp;the height of the pandemic.&nbsp; \"I don't think he received any help at all,\" said Beaton, who lives in&nbsp;Delhi, Ont.&nbsp; \"He was totally frustrated from the service that he was receiving with his addiction counsellors leaving because of non-payment of wages.\" Beaton's son, Drew, was kicked out of the program for disruptive behaviour and sent back to jail following the terms of his release from custody for treatment. It was the first time the 35-year-old had ever attended a treatment program, and Beaton worries he never will again. \"I tried to avoid this. I wanted to help him,\" she said. \"He really got a bad taste of what a facility for addiction and mental health would be.\" Now Beaton says she's out $12,500 that she took from her retirement savings to cover the cost of her son's treatment. He has been released from custody, is homeless and continues to struggle with addiction. Beaton's son was given warnings, owner says Haines confirmed that Beaton's son did receive treatment at the Brampton facility. He told CBC News in an interview that staff gave Drew several warnings and second chances about his behaviour before he was discharged. \"We do not guarantee 100 per cent success,\" Haines said. \"We try our hardest and that's why we have a guarantee to bring them back.\"&nbsp; Haines also acknowledged high turnover in addiction counsellors at his facility at that time, but says they only provide secondary support. Therapists are the primary providers of treatment at ARN, he says.&nbsp; Former ARN employees and clients who spoke to CBC News want to see the province establish oversight of private addiction treatment because they argue the stakes are much higher&nbsp;compared to other unregulated consumer services.&nbsp; Rebecca Deguara is one of the former employees who'd like to see the industry regulated. She worked as a part-time addiction counselor at ARN's Brampton facility while Beaton's son was there for treatment in the spring.&nbsp; \"I didn't necessarily see him as being a troublemaker per se,\" she told CBC News. \"He was trying to express his frustration.\" 'Window of opportunity' for treatment Deguara is a retired parole officer and has more than 30 years of experience in social work that has involved people with addictions. \"There's a window of opportunity when the person is ready to actually seek help and when that window opens,&nbsp;you want that to be a fruitful, positive experience,\" she said. \"Hearing what Drew went through, and the fact that he expressed that he never wants to go through treatment again, that to me is a crime in and of itself.\"&nbsp; And Beaton's son isn't the only one,\" she said.&nbsp; Deguara says other clients expressed concerns about not getting the treatment they paid for. She had particular concerns about a client who arrived in a wheelchair from hospital even though the facility wasn't accessible.&nbsp; \"Once [the client] was inside the building there were no hygiene facilities for him to shower,\" said Deguara. \"My understanding was a week went by and he was not able to wash himself at all.\" Deguara stated that she only worked a few weekends at the facility before she quit because she didn't feel safe being alone with one other counsellor and about 10 clients who were upset about their treatment. \"My heart was broken to see clients that were in really dire need of true help, and treatment, not getting it,\" she told CBC News. &nbsp; Haines disputes Deguara's account of clients' experiences at his facility, and says she wasn't a good fit as a counsellor and there was a \"mutual separation.\"&nbsp; As for the client in the wheelchair, Haines told CBC News the man was admitted pro bono because a hospital said he needed urgent attention, and his facility doesn't otherwise treat clients with accessibility needs at the Brampton centre because it isn't accessible.&nbsp; Testimonial videos starring actors Maya Day decided to fly from her home in Edmonton to Toronto to attend ARN's Brampton facility for treatment for her alcohol addiction earlier this month.&nbsp; She says she was sold on a combination of the executive-style treatment offered and testimonial videos on ARN's website.&nbsp; \"[The testimonials] meant a lot to me because video carries a lot of weight when you're seeing a person speak to their experience,\" Day said.&nbsp; CBC News found that at least four of the company's testimonial videos feature actors who appear in other testimonials and commercials online.&nbsp; Day says the centre&nbsp;was more run&nbsp;down than she saw in photos. She also told CBC News she was uncomfortable with the facility's plan to give her diazepam to help with withdrawal symptoms, since she says she hadn't received a medical assessment \u2014 and never saw any medical staff on-site to supervise such a&nbsp;treatment plan. As a result, Day told her husband not to pay the remaining $22,500 for her treatment, and left the Brampton facility for Edmonton 24 hours later. \"It was, you know, not easy to come up with that money but we made it a priority,\" said Day.&nbsp; \"There's families out there, they're scraping together their savings to maybe put a child in treatment \u2026 It'd be a shame for them to end up spending their life's savings on an unregulated place.\" Haines says some actors were used for old testimonial videos due to client privacy concerns, but the words they said belonged to real clients. He told CBC News he would consider making that distinction clear on the videos.&nbsp; As for&nbsp;Day, Haines says diazepam is a normal, short-term treatment for alcohol withdrawal and he thinks she wasn't ready for treatment.&nbsp; Haines&nbsp;says he agrees&nbsp;with the former employees and clients about one thing:&nbsp; the need for regulations on&nbsp;private addiction facilities in Ontario.&nbsp; \"I'd be all for it,\" he said. \"And if they said, 'Sorry, you can't,' then I'd hand it off. But I can tell you our program is second-to-none;&nbsp;our program will definitely be approved.\" No plans to regulate private addiction treatment In a statement, the Ministry of Health told CBC News there are no plans to regulate private addiction treatment providers at the moment.&nbsp; Instead, the government said its committed $3.8 billion over 10 years to improve community-based services, including publicly funded residential addiction services.&nbsp; In addition to regulating addiction treatment centres, Haines also told CBC News he'd like to see the province require addiction counselors to be licensed so companies&nbsp;like his would have a reputable list of counselors to hire.&nbsp; That's the direction that Alberta has gone in terms of regulation. All private addiction treatment providers have to be licenced by the government, and soon addictions counseling will be added to the professions in Alberta's Health Professions Act (HPA). Haines's past addiction companies declare bankruptcy This isn't the first time concerns about Haines' facilities have been raised with CBC News.&nbsp; CBC's   first reported about  , despite government orders, in 2015.&nbsp; Then further reporting the following year revealed Haines's two companies,&nbsp;  as Haines faced criminal charges connected to the addiction treatment businesses.&nbsp; The charges against Haines were dropped in November 2017 and he paid a $5,000 mischief fine for having an unlicensed doctor on staff. In early 2018, both of Haines's previous companies declared bankruptcy and he started Addiction Recovery Network.&nbsp; Haines also operated another addiction treatment facility in Alberta, which was closed down by the provincial&nbsp;government last fall  . The current company, ARN, owes nearly $97,000 in unpaid wages from 36 employment standards complaints the Ministry of Labour has ordered ARN to pay up on since 2018.&nbsp; Haines was found in default by the government on orders to pay more than $76,000 of those wages, and a warrant of seizure and sale was issued against him personally in York Region last month to try to reclaim those funds.&nbsp;   I don't profess to be a nice boss if they're not doing their job.     Haines says all&nbsp;the unpaid wages are for employees who were fired or quit and so he held out on paying their last paycheque because their departures left other employees and clients in the lurch. \"I don't profess to be a nice boss if they're not doing their job,\" said Haines.&nbsp; \"I'm wrong when I don't pay them their last paycheque, so I'm going to right that \u2014 but again, they have to understand the damage that they did.\" Haines told CBC News he plans to work out a payment plan with the government for the unpaid wages he owes.&nbsp;"

But critics say the deal will not prevent global temperatures from rising more than 1.5 degrees Celsius above the pre-industrial average, which scientists say will trigger catastrophic and irreversible impacts, from melting ice sheets to the collapse of ocean currents. \"This text is toothless and it is nowhere even close to being sufficient to keep us within the 1.5-degree limit,\" Thunberg told Reuters outside Sweden's parliament where she and a handful of other protesters were calling for climate justice. \"It is a stab in the back for those most vulnerable.\" 'An alibi' for world leaders: Thunberg The Alliance of Small Island States, which includes countries most affected by climate change like Fiji, Tuvalu and Kiribati, said the agreement was full of loopholes and was \"incremental and not transformational.\" Thunberg, 20, who shot to fame as the face of climate activism in 2018 after she started staging weekly protests in Sweden, said the pact was not designed to solve the climate crisis but as \"an alibi\" for world leaders that allowed them to ignore global warming. \"As long as we don't treat the climate crisis as a crisis and as long as we keep lobby interests influencing these texts and these processes, we are not going to get anywhere,\" she said."

He's since&nbsp;dedicated nearly 70 years to the game in his tiny southeastern New Brunswick hometown of Hoyt, about 50 kilometres south of Fredericton. For that&nbsp;reason,&nbsp;Gillett has been selected to be inducted into Softball Canada's hall of fame.&nbsp; \"It's been my life,\" Gillett&nbsp;said from the dugout on the field he built. \"This is my home away from home.\"&nbsp; Gillett remembers clearing alders in the 1950s to make room for the ball field that is still used every week.&nbsp;It has&nbsp;since been renamed the George Gillett Field&nbsp;in his honour. In the '60s he coached his team to a Maritime Championship. He would go on to coach the Hoyt Schooners to that title more than a dozen times. He'd coach them to more than 40 provincial championships as well.&nbsp; In 1981, Gillett&nbsp; worked to install the first set of lights in a New Brunswick ball field, allowing games to be played late into the night.&nbsp; He's kept scorebooks for nearly every game ever played on that field, dating back to 1959.&nbsp; But ask him how many teams he's coached and he's at a loss.&nbsp; \"Oh my God, I couldn't count them all, I don't think,\" Gillett said. \"I'd take a team when they were five years old and coach them until they were at least 18 or 20. \"One time I coached [until they were] 45 or so. That's&nbsp;how I won all the&nbsp;championships.\"&nbsp; Gillett has kept a jersey from every&nbsp;Hoyt team that's ever played at the rec centre next to his field, along with dozens of trophies&nbsp;and photos from every team he's coached or played on. That includes the very first team he played on back in the '40's. \"I'm the only surviving member of that team,\" said Gillett. \"The rest are all passed on.\" At 87,&nbsp;Gillett still works on the Hoyt ball field daily, although he admits friends and neighbours often chase him off the field for working too hard.&nbsp;&nbsp; Last week he&nbsp;helped install new playground equipment at the ball field in the memory of his late wife, Anna. As much time as he spent on the ball field, he said, she matched it working at the ball field's canteen, serving up \"millions\" of hotdogs to those in the stands over the decades. He still visits her twice a day at the cemetery&nbsp;near his home. Once in the morning and once at night,&nbsp;under the headstone that bears their names along with a large carving of a ball field inscribed with the words \"Field of Dreams.\"&nbsp; After coaching countless teams since the '50s,&nbsp;Gillett can still rattle off the names and stats of the players he&nbsp;coached who went on to play in much bigger leagues than the Maritimes.&nbsp; \"Sonny Phillips, he went to the Pan-America Games, he was the winning catcher,\" said Gillett. \"And Lindsay Tracy, Donald Nason, Terry Youngblood.\"&nbsp; Those players&nbsp;say they owe much of their success to Gillett's&nbsp;tutelage. \"We call George the godfather of softball,\" said Jeremy Tracy.&nbsp; After playing softball as a child in Hoyt, coached by Gillett, Tracy&nbsp;went on to play fast-pitch softball across North America at the World&nbsp;level and&nbsp;spent a few years playing for Team Canada. A fellow New Brunswick Sports Hall of Famer, Tracy said softball owes a lot to Gillett.&nbsp; \"Softball probably wouldn't even still be going if wasn't for George still being involved in the game,\" he said.&nbsp;\"There's no person more deserving.\" Those who still live in Hoyt point to softball and the field&nbsp;Gillett built as the&nbsp;centre&nbsp;of the community.&nbsp; \"George is my oldest friend,\" said David Kirkpatrick. \"I've had two grandfathers that have passed, but I've still got my George.\"&nbsp; Kirkpatrick was&nbsp;nine years old&nbsp;when he started playing softball, coached by Gillett. He can still remember going to tournaments with 12 other&nbsp;players, plus equipment, stuffed into Gillett's eight-seater van. Now 45, he still plays for the Hoyt Schooners. And George comes to every one of his home games.&nbsp; \"I don't think I'd know what community was if it wasn't for George,\" said Kirkpatrick.&nbsp; Despite the praise, Gillett&nbsp;said he kind of wishes people would stop nominating him for halls&nbsp;of fame. He was inducted into the New Brunswick Softball Hall of Fame in its inaugural year, back in 1994. \"I didn't really need another one,\" he said. \"I've got three now. Sport New Brunswick, Softball New Brunswick, and Oromocto and Area. Five of my teams have been in the hall too, but I guess I&nbsp;have to&nbsp;do what I'm told now.\"&nbsp; Gillett will be inducted, along with John MacEwen of Nova Scotia, at the Softball Canada annual general meeting, set for Nov. 11-13 in Fredericton.&nbsp;&nbsp;"

    "body": "The B.C. coroner's report into the deaths of   laid clear the stark reality of how much the climate has changed in Canada in the past century \u2014 and how ill-prepared our homes and residences are for absorbing high temperatures. \"Current building codes in B.C. do not consider cooling in the same manner as they consider heat,\" Dr. Jatinder Baidwan, chief medical officer at the B.C. Coroners Service, said during a news conference last Tuesday, following the report's release. \"As codes are revised, they will need to reflect the current climate science.\" While landlords across Canada are required to maintain certain levels of heat in dwellings during colder months \u2014 usually about 21 C \u2014 and utilities are banned from cutting off heat during the winter, no similar regulation exists to deal with excessive heat in the summer.&nbsp; The coroner's office says it's time to adapt.&nbsp; \"Building codes that require passive and active cooling (heat pumps, building materials, insulation, ventilation, greening, tree canopy, landscape permeability, solar reflectivity, etc.) can mitigate the effects of extreme heat events,\"&nbsp; . It recommended retrofitting&nbsp;current&nbsp;codes to encourage active and passive cooling in existing housing, especially in lower income areas. &nbsp; 'Necessary but insufficient' As codes are written now, and with most buildings having a lifespan of anywhere from 50 to 100 years, experts say it would take decades to \"future-proof\" existing dwellings to adequately address more immediately anticipated climate conditions, particularly around extreme weather or other anomalies of climate change. Andrew Pape-Salmon calls updating building codes \"necessary but insufficient action.\"&nbsp; The adjunct professor of civil engineering at the University of Victoria, who has&nbsp;expertise in energy efficiency and building and safety standards, says changing codes would probably be the most impactful way of tackling the issue&nbsp;\u2014 since it would be a way of ensuring that specific technical standards would be universally applied for new construction. But it's certainly not the quickest, he said. The City of Vancouver recently approved&nbsp; &nbsp;that would require new multi-family dwellings of a certain size to have mechanical cooling to keep temperatures indoors at no more than 26 C with the windows closed, though&nbsp;it doesn't go into effect until January 2025. \"The challenge with the building code is that it really only touches somewhere on the order of four to six per cent of the building stock in any particular year,\" said Pape-Salmon, since it typically only affects new builds.&nbsp; Keeping residents cool is not yet a widespread regulatory norm in this country, and Canadian summers are getting hotter.&nbsp;According to Environment Canada, most of Canada's main cities experienced more days over 30 C in 2021 than average, and overall, last year's summer temperatures were higher than average.&nbsp; Temperatures in parts of B.C. surpassed 40 C for several days during the 2021 heat dome, and most of the people who died were elderly or vulnerable individuals living in buildings without air conditioning. Incentive programs more efficient This is where incentive programs \u2014 also encouraged in the coroner's report \u2014 might be more efficient, said Pape-Salmon, who previously worked for the B.C. Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing in the Building and Safety Standards Branch.&nbsp; They might spark a landlord to undertake a renovation sooner, rather than waiting until it becomes a necessity.&nbsp; He said&nbsp;there are many very strong provincial and federal incentive programs, but most have been focused on preparing homes to lose less heat in the winter.&nbsp; \"What we need to do is keep the heat out in the summer.&nbsp;And that is not a central feature of neither the building code nor these incentive programs. So it does require a bit of an adjustment.\"&nbsp; In a statement, British Columbia's minister of public safety said that \"all recommendations within the BC Coroners Service's report will be carefully reviewed and considered,\" while noting that many are already underway&nbsp;\u2014&nbsp;including&nbsp; , which alerts people, First Nations and local governments of heat warnings and extreme heat emergencies.&nbsp;The provincial government said it has also created an extreme heat preparedness guide, outlining&nbsp;how people can stay safe as temperatures rise. The federal government, meanwhile, currently offers the&nbsp; , which provides grants to&nbsp;homeowners for evaluations and eligible&nbsp;energy-efficient retrofits.&nbsp; A move to heat pumps Sheena Sharp, president of Coolearth Architecture in Toronto, says the most immediate solution to deadly heat is to get air conditioning into buildings \u2014 even if it means cooling just one room in a dwelling \u2014 while also working on more sustainable medium-term solutions, such as heat pumps, which&nbsp; . \"Over the next 15 years, most residential furnaces will break down. That's about their lifetime,\" she said. \"If we replace those with a heat pump combo, heating and cooling, then that would solve our emissions problem and \u2026 move us toward&nbsp;better comfort in these heating events.\"&nbsp; Sharp, who&nbsp;ran for the Green Party of Ontario in the last provincial election, would like to see the day when,  , installing a gas appliance in a home will be prohibited and heat pumps will become the norm. And over&nbsp;the long term, she says, it will be necessary to upgrade the \"envelope\" of existing buildings&nbsp;\u2014&nbsp;\"meaning better windows, better walls, better roofs.\" Passive cooling As for the short term, scientist Alexandra Rempel says passive cooling is key.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The assistant professor of environmental studies at the University of Oregon just authored&nbsp;  that hit the Pacific Northwest, including B.C., that will be published in September.&nbsp; Passive cooling works without the use of mechanical equipment, such as an air conditioner, relying instead on natural ventilation \u2014 like cooler night air \u2014 as well as shading and greenery, where possible.&nbsp; Using   as a term of reference, Rempel's study looked at how passive cooling could have reduced dangerous levels of heat stress during the heat dome. It wasn't about not feeling hot, but rather&nbsp;about avoiding getting to levels where the body would be stressed physically.&nbsp; Uncomfortable, but not deadly \"The important thing is to keep that physiological stress level \u2026 out of the danger and extreme danger levels, and closer down to the, you know, kind of like caution levels,\" she said, which is about 32 C. \"It's not going to necessarily be comfortable, but it shouldn't be deadly.\" The key is to allow cool air in at every opportunity. So any time the outside air is cooler than the indoor air, she says, open windows if it's safe. \"In the western part of the country that will be, you know, still about eight to 10 hours overnight.\" Rempel&nbsp;also recommends using a fan to facilitate the air coming in, where possible.&nbsp; In the morning, close the windows and fully shade them from the sun \u2014 east-facing in the morning, and west&nbsp;or south-facing at night. And it doesn't have to involve costly coverings, such as built-in blinds or heavy curtains.&nbsp; \"Create some kind of a makeshift insert for that window,\" Rempel said. \"It could be foam or cardboard or \u2026 wood panels. It could be almost anything that you have to fill in that entire window area, so that air from the inside of the dwelling doesn't circulate against that hot glass surface and come back into the room.\" Building owners can also look at installing exterior shading on tracks that could be moved over windows as needed, she says, while homeowners can increase tree shading on their property, and open&nbsp;windows on opposite sides of the house and on different levels when it's cooler outdoors.&nbsp; In Portland, Ore., where the highest temperatures of the heat dome were recorded from June 26-28, Rempel's study found that \"integrated shading and natural ventilation eliminated all hours above the danger threshold,\" during those three days, lowering peak indoor air temperatures by approximately 14 C.&nbsp; In Vancouver, she said, nighttime heat dome temperatures hovered around the 26 C mark, but even getting that \"cooler\" air indoors overnight would have helped.&nbsp; Again, she said, the goal is to move indoors conditions away from a \"danger\" zone and move it toward a \"caution\" level. \"People are still kind of at risk of heat exhaustion, but you're out of the likelihood of heat stroke area.\""

The conversation completely changed his perspective on his achievements.&nbsp; \"With not an ounce of sarcasm, he went, 'And now your problem is success,'\" he tells  .&nbsp; \"Who's had more success than George Lucas? But he didn't say it like, 'Congratulations.' He was like, 'Now your problem is success.

But he was so taken with the   screenplay that he decided to do it. He says that this version of Mufasa is very different from the one audiences got to know in the original 1994 film. \"When we think of Mufasa, we think of the best dad ever, living in the clouds and giving us advice,\" Miranda&nbsp; says. \"This Mufasa is nothing like that. This is young Mufasa figuring it out. It's not unlike seeing home movies of your parents as younger people and being like, 'Oh my God, they don't know what they're doing.'\" &nbsp;"

Designed in partnership with Zeidler Architecture and Jones &amp; Jones Architects, the space mimics orangutans' natural habitat while fostering an immersive experience. \"This habitat really brings the guests close to the animals,\" said Ben Knoop, a project manager at the zoo. He says the goal of the habitat is to help guests better understand orangutans while educating them on the threats humans pose through palm oil plantations. While the 13,000-square-foot space officially opened over the summer, the zoo says its seven Sumatran orangutans only recently started exploring their new Rouge forest home. \"It's the most natural-looking space of our habitats,\" said Knoop. He says the new space, \"allows the orangutans to act naturally and perform behaviours that they would in the wild, like forage for food or play in a stream.\" Although the orangutans have begun curiously exploring the new outdoor space, the Toronto Zoo says that as the weather gets colder, they'll stay in a covered habitat until temperatures warm up again in the spring."

    "body": "                       The presidents of four countries on Russia's doorstep visited Ukraine on Wednesday and underscored their support for the embattled country, where they saw heavily damaged buildings and demanded accountability for what they called war crimes carried out by Russian forces. The visit by the presidents of Poland, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia was a strong show of solidarity by the leaders of the countries on NATO's eastern flank, three of them \u2014 like Ukraine \u2014&nbsp;once part of the Soviet Union. They travelled by train to the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, to meet Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky&nbsp;and visited Borodyanka, one of the towns near Kyiv where evidence of atrocities was found after Russian troops withdrew to focus on the country's east. \"The fight for Europe's future is happening here,\" Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda said, calling for tougher sanctions, including against Russia's oil and gas shipments and all the country's banks. Elsewhere, in one of the most crucial battles of the war, Russia said more than 1,000 Ukrainian troops had surrendered in the besieged port of Mariupol, where Ukrainian forces have been holding out in pockets of the city. The information could not be verified. Russia invaded on Feb. 24 with the goal, according to Western officials, of taking Kyiv, toppling the government and installing a Moscow-friendly regime. In the seven weeks since, the ground advance stalled and Russian forces lost potentially thousands of fighters \u2014 and the war has forced millions of Ukrainians to flee, rattled the world economy, threatened global food supplies and shattered Europe's post-Cold War balance. More weapons for Ukraine A day after he called Russia's actions in Ukraine \"a genocide,\" U.S. President Joe Biden approved $800 million US in new military assistance to Ukraine, saying weapons from the West have sustained Ukraine's fight so far and \"we cannot rest now.\" The weapons include artillery systems, armoured personnel carriers and helicopters. Appearing alongside Zelensky in an ornate room in Kyiv's historic&nbsp;Mariinskyi Palace on Tuesday, the European leaders \u2014 Nauseda, Estonian President Alar Karis, Poland's Andrzej Duda and Egils Levits of Latvia \u2014 reiterated their commitments to supporting Ukraine politically and with transfers of military aid. \"We know this history. We know what Russian occupation means. We know what Russian terrorism means,\" Duda said, adding that&nbsp;those who committed war crimes as well as those who gave the orders should be held accountable. \"If someone sends aircraft, if someone sends troops to shell residential districts, kill civilians, murder them, this is not war,\" he said. \"This is cruelty, this is banditry, this is terrorism.\" &nbsp; Zelensky thanks Biden, 4 visiting presidents Zelensky said he's \"sincerely thankful\" to the U.S. for the new round of&nbsp;military assistance. In his daily late-night address to the nation, Zelensky also said he was thankful for Wednesday's visit by the presidents of Poland, Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia. He said those leaders \"have helped us from the first day, those who did not hesitate to give us weapons, those who did not doubt whether to impose sanctions.\" The Ukrainian president&nbsp;also said work was continuing to clear tens of thousands of unexploded shells, mines and trip wires that were left behind in northern Ukraine by the retreating Russians. He urged those returning to their homes in that region to be wary of any unfamiliar object and report it to the police. Putin defends assault on Ukraine An expert report commissioned by the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe found \"clear patterns of [international humanitarian law]&nbsp;violations by the Russian forces in their conduct of hostilities.\" The report was written by experts selected by Ukraine and published Wednesday by the Vienna-based organization that promotes security and human rights. The report said that there were also violations by Ukraine, but concluded those committed by Russia \"are by far larger in scale and nature.\" Ukraine has previously acknowledged that there could be \"isolated incidents\" of violations and has said it would investigate. Putin, however, has denied his troops committed atrocities, and on Tuesday said that Moscow \"had no other choice\" but to invade and that the offensive&nbsp;aimed to protect people in parts of Eastern Ukraine and to \"ensure Russia's own security.\" He vowed it would \"continue until its full completion and the fulfilment of the tasks that have been set.\" He insisted Russia's campaign was going as planned despite a major withdrawal after its forces failed to take the capital and suffered significant losses. Following those setbacks,&nbsp;Russian troops are now gearing up for a major offensive in the eastern Donbas region,&nbsp;where Russian-allied separatists and Ukrainian forces have been fighting since 2014, and where Russia has recognized the separatists' claims of independence. Military strategists say Moscow believes local support, logistics and the terrain in the region favour its larger, better-armed military, potentially allowing Russia to finally turn the tide in its favour. Battle for Mariupol continues A key piece to that campaign is Mariupol, which lies in the Donbas and which the Russians have pummelled since nearly the start of the war.&nbsp;Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podoliak&nbsp;tweeted that the city's defenders were short of supplies but were \"fighting under the bombs for each metre of the city.\" Russian Defence Ministry spokesperson Maj.-Gen. Igor Konashenkov said 1,026 troops from the Ukrainian 36th Marine Brigade had surrendered in the city. It was unclear when this occurred or how many forces were still defending Mariupol. According to the BBC, Aiden Aslin, a British man fighting in the Ukrainian military in Mariupol, called his mother and a friend to say he and his comrades were out of food, ammunition and other supplies and would surrender. Russian state television on Wednesday broadcast footage that it said was from the port city showing dozens of men in camouflage outfits walking with their hands up and carrying others on stretchers or in chair holds. One man held a white flag on a staff in one hand and the handle of a stretcher in another. In the background was a tall industrial building with its windows shattered and its roof missing, identified by the broadcaster as the Iliich metalworks. Another Zelensky&nbsp;adviser Oleksiy Arestovych did not comment on the surrender claim, but said in a post on Twitter that elements of the same brigade managed to link up with other Ukrainian forces in the city as a result of a \"risky manoeuvre.\" &nbsp; Claims&nbsp;Russia used poisonous substance Ukrainian Deputy Defence Minister Hanna Maliar said the country&nbsp;is investigating a claim that a drone dropped a poisonous substance on the city. She said it was possible phosphorus munitions had been used in Mariupol. Phosphorus munitions are not formally classed as chemical weapons but they cause horrendous burn, and deliberately firing phosphorus munitions into an enclosed space to expose people to fumes could breach the Chemical Weapons Convention, said Marc-Michael Blum, a former laboratory head at the Netherlands-based Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. &nbsp; Biden said it would be up to lawyers to decide if Russia's conduct met the international standard for genocide, but said \"it sure seems that way to me.\" Prime Minister Justin Trudeau noted that   but added of Biden's using the term, \"I think it's absolutely right that more people \u2026 [are]&nbsp;talking and using the word genocide in terms of what Russia is doing and Vladimir Putin has done.\" \"The way they are targeting Ukrainian identity and culture, these are all things that are war crimes that Putin that is responsible for,\" Trudeau said. French President Emmanuel Macron declined to use the word but said \"it has been established that war crimes have been committed by the Russian army.\" \"We must find those responsible and bring them to justice,\" he told France-2 television. On Wednesday,&nbsp;the Kremlin said it categorically disagreed with Biden's description of Russia's actions in Ukraine as genocide. \"We consider this kind of effort to distort the situation unacceptable,\" Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on a conference call with reporters. War crimes&nbsp;investigation An International Criminal Court investigation into war crimes is underway in Ukraine, including into atrocities revealed after Moscow's retreat from the Kyiv area, where Ukrainian authorities say more than 720 people were killed, with 403 bodies found in the town of Bucha alone. ICC prosecutor Karim Khan, who visited Bucha, said in a tweet Wednesday that Ukraine \"is a crime scene\" and the court must \"pierce the fog of war\" to determine what has occurred. Residents in Yahidne, a village near the northern city of Chernihiv, said Russian troops forced them to stay for almost a month in the basement of a school, only allowing them outside to go to the toilet, cook on open fires \u2014 and bury those who died in a mass grave. In one of the rooms, the residents wrote the names of those who perished during the ordeal \u2014 the list counted 18 people. \"An old man died near me and then his wife died next,\" said resident Valentyna Saroyan. \"Then a man died who was lying there, then a woman sitting next to me.... She died as well. Another old man looked so healthy, he was doing exercises, but then he was sitting and fell. That was it.\" In the Odesa region, Gov. Maksym Marchenko said forces struck the guided-missile cruiser Moskva \u2014 the flagship of Russia's Black Sea Fleet \u2014 with two missiles and caused \"serious damage.\" The Russian Defence Ministry confirmed the ship was damaged but not that it was hit by Ukraine \u2014 it said ammunition on board detonated as a result of a fire whose causes \"were being established.\" The entire crew was evacuated from the ship, it added."

    "body": "Revenu Quebec agents had been investigating Uber for weeks, including making undercover visits to the company's Montreal offices and following its Quebec general manager to work one day. They suspected the ride-hailing service was improperly declaring that it owed no provincial sales tax and helping some drivers dodge that tax and the federal GST.&nbsp; On May 13, 2015, they got a search warrant, and the next day they  . But at 10:40 a.m., at two Uber offices in Montreal, investigators noticed company laptops, smartphones and tablets suddenly all restarted at exactly the same time. Worried that data on the devices might be being manipulated from afar, the agents powered them down. They seized 14 computers, 74 phones and some documents, according to court records obtained by CBC/Radio-Canada. Uber's Quebec general manager at the time, Jean-Nicolas Guillemette, told the investigators that he had contacted engineers at the company's headquarters in San Francisco who had encrypted all the data remotely. What happened in Montreal was far from an isolated incident, but a tactic Uber used to try to thwart authorities in cities where it was trying to establish its business, according to documents found in the Uber Files, a large new leak of internal records from the gig-economy company.&nbsp;&nbsp; The leaked records show how the company that launched itself as a luxury ride service in San Francisco in 2010 tried to surmount legal and political obstacles through a complex choreography of lobbying, cultivating influential allies, dodging authorities and ignoring the rules when they appeared inconvenient. The leaked files contain 124,000 records, including 83,000 emails, iMessages and Whatsapp exchanges between Uber's most senior executives as well as memos, presentations and invoices. The records, spanning from 2013 to 2017, shed light on a period when Uber was aggressively expanding and operating illegally by ignoring taxi regulations in many cities around the world, including in Canada.&nbsp; The files were leaked to   and shared with the Washington-based  , a non-profit newsroom and network of journalists whose media partners include CBC/Radio-Canada, the Toronto Star, the Washington Post, the BBC and Le Monde. In a statement to the ICIJ, Jill Hazelbaker, a spokeswoman for Uber, acknowledged \"mistakes\" and \"missteps\" that culminated five years ago in \"one of the most infamous reckonings in the history of corporate America,\" but that the company had changed its practices since 2017.&nbsp; Thwarting authorities The leaked files reveal that a \"kill switch,\" as it was referred to internally, and an encryption software were also deployed in France, the Netherlands, Hungary, Romania and India, as government authorities raided company offices to enforce tax, transportation and other laws. The \"kill switch\" would remotely cut access to the company servers located in San Francisco and prevent government authorities from getting company files while local staff would still appear to be collaborating with investigators.&nbsp; According to a 2015 leaked email from a legal director for Uber in western Europe, the company was particularly concerned that authorities could get access to their list of drivers, making it \"much easier for the taxman, regulators and police to terrify our supply\" and enforce against it. \"If we hand over the driver list, our goose may be cooked,\" he added. In one of the first such uses of the kill switch that shows up in the leak, when France's competition and consumer agency raided the company's Paris offices in November 2014, Uber's European legal director at the time sent out an email titled \"Kill Paris access now\" at 3:14 p.m. local time. Thirteen minutes later, an engineering manager wrote back: \"Done now.\"&nbsp;&nbsp; During a July 2015 raid by the French tax agency, Mark MacGann, the top Uber lobbyist in Europe, advised Thibauld Simphal, then head of Uber France, that employees play dumb when the kill switch is activated, according to leaked text messages.&nbsp; \"Try a few laptops, appear confused when you cannot get access, say that IT team is in [San Francisco] and fast asleep.\"&nbsp; The French manager responded: \"Oh yeah we've used that playbook so many times by now the most difficult part is continuing to act surprised!\" MacGann told the Guardian he was just following orders. \"On every occasion where I was personally involved in 'kill switch' activities, I was acting on the express orders from my management in San Francisco,\" he said. Simphal, now Uber global head of sustainability, said all his interactions with public authorities were conducted in good faith. During an April 2015 raid on its Amsterdam offices, Uber's manager for Western Europe emailed a company engineer: \"Kill switch in [Amsterdam] asap please.\"&nbsp; Uber's co-founder and then-CEO, Travis Kalanick, was looped into the email chain. Seven minutes later, he wrote: \"Please hit the kill switch ASAP.... Access must be shut down in [Amsterdam].\"&nbsp; In a statement sent to ICIJ, a spokesperson for Kalanick said that the former CEO never authorized any actions or programs that would obstruct justice in any country. He said Uber, like other businesses operating overseas, used tools to protect intellectual property and the privacy of its customers, and ensure due process rights in the event of an extrajudicial raid. Kalanick's spokesperson also said that the protocols do not delete any data and that all decisions about their use were vetted and approved by Uber's legal and regulatory departments. After the Montreal raid, Uber went to court to dispute the validity of the search warrants obtained by Revenu Qu\u00e9bec. A   that the warrants were valid. He also mentioned that the remote shutdown and encryption of electronic devices \"bears all the hallmarks of an attempt to obstruct justice\" and that a judge could reasonably conclude that the company was seeking to hide evidence of illegal conduct from tax authorities.&nbsp; It's unclear what happened next with the investigation.&nbsp;A spokesperson for Revenu Quebec told CBC/Radio-Canada that the agency can't comment on current or past investigations. Uber eventually reached an agreement with Revenu Qu\u00e9bec under which the company would collect the GST and QST on behalf of its drivers and remit the amounts to tax authorities. Uber today trades as a public company worth $42 billion US \u2014 about the same as CIBC. It says it operates in more than 10,000 cities and more than 70 countries. Its name has become a byword for ride-hailing apps in the many markets where it dominates, and it has branched into food delivery.&nbsp; But at a bird's eye level, the leaked records underscore that there was nothing inevitable about the company's meteoric rise since its launch in San Francisco in 2010.&nbsp; Uber's deliberate strategy to establish itself would bring a lot of headaches, too. In a 2014 leaked presentation, the company characterized these issues as \"the pyramid of shit,\" formed by layers of direct litigation, administrative procedures, regulatory investigations and driver lawsuits. Uber sought political allies to help it get around those hurdles and to keep pushing forward. 'Backchannel route around Montreal' When the UberX service launched in Montreal in 2014, Mayor Denis Coderre immediately  \"of course it's illegal.\"&nbsp; Behind the scenes, Uber's head of policy development sent an internal email saying: \"This was fully anticipated and known but we're working with the province and Quebec City as a back channel route around Montreal.\"&nbsp; When Unifor, Canada's largest private sector union, called for the Ontario government to intervene after UberX launched in Ottawa in October 2014, the same policy manager wrote: \"We have met with and continue to meet with relevant provincial cabinet ministers to head off this issue.\u2026 We are meeting relevant provincial ministers across provinces in Canada.\"&nbsp;&nbsp; The next month, the City of Toronto decided to pursue an injunction against Uber for allegedly violating its taxi and limousine regulations.&nbsp; The same day, mayor-elect John Tory issued a media release  , saying: \"Uber is a technology whose time has come, and which is here to stay.\"&nbsp; A leaked internal memo suggests that Uber's policy team had \"worked to secure [the] extremely positive response\" from Tory.&nbsp; Tory's office didn't respond to our questions. On Oct. 4, 2014, John Baird, the federal minister of foreign affairs in Prime Minister Stephen Harper's cabinet, complained   and   of having waited 75 minutes for a cab in Ottawa. He publicly called on the city to allow Uber, which had started operating illegally in the capital. A few days later, Uber's policy team claimed to have \"secured the foreign minister of Canada as a public endorser,\" according to a leaked internal memo.&nbsp; Baird's spokesperson, Michael Ceci, said the former minister \"has no recollection of Uber Canada staff contacting him.\"&nbsp; Uber also sought to influence elected officials and public opinion in Alberta.&nbsp; In Edmonton, when UberX launched in December 2014, an internal memo sent to policy and communications staff noted: \"Policy secured the popular former three-term mayor Bill Smith as our Rider Zero, a favourable op-ed in the Edmonton Journal by well-known Edmonton businessman Chris LaBossiere and friend of the current mayor, favourable tweets from Uber-supportive Edmonton city councillor Michael Walters and met with the deputy chief of staff to the mayor (second formal meeting to date) where it was confirmed that the mayor 'is there' with respect to ridesharing.\"&nbsp; Earlier that fall, another pro-Uber   in the Journal signed by David MacLean, who was then vice-president of Alberta Enterprise Group, a business lobby organization. An internal Uber email a week later suggests the company's policy and communications team had \"worked with\" the organization on the piece.&nbsp; Michael Walters and David MacLean did not respond to a request for comments from CBC/Radio-Canada.&nbsp; Chris LaBossiere said in an email that Uber did indeed contact him about writing an op-ed, but he said he wrote the piece because he supported shaking up Edmonton's taxi industry and also believed ride-sharing in general could help reduce impaired driving. When some Calgary city councillors pushed for a regulatory framework for ride-hailing services like Uber, the company launched its service there before new rules were adopted.&nbsp; \"Anticipating that the framework will make it hard for us to operate, we are planning to launch this Thursday,\" an internal memo says. A spokesperson for Uber Canada told CBC/Radio-Canada that in the early years, Uber met with elected officials \"to brief them on the technology\" and whenever someone expressed support for regulating the industry, it was noted. Katie Wells, a postdoctoral researcher at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C., who has published papers about Uber, said much of the company's behaviour can be understood as a product of a libertarian world view preferring small government with power concentrated in the hands of corporations calling many of the shots.&nbsp; \"They think they're better than the state,\" Wells said. \"What they've done through all this lobbying work is they try to eviscerate the state \u2014 they try to evade it, they try to lessen it, they try to say: 'Don't worry about it, we'll take care of that.'\" 'Violence guarantee success' Many cities tried to shut Uber down by seeking injunctions, impounding vehicles and issuing fines to drivers.&nbsp; In an internal email from 2014, Uber's head of global communications at the time, Nairi Hourdajian, wrote \"sometimes we have problems because, well, we're just f--king illegal.\"&nbsp; When approached by ICIJ, Hourdajian declined to comment.&nbsp; The taxi industry was outraged and staged protests in many cities, including Montreal, where some taxi drivers  at the Pierre Elliott Trudeau International Airport and pelted Uber drivers with eggs and snowballs.&nbsp; In 2015, a protest in Paris turned violent, with vehicles set on fire and rocks thrown at Uber drivers. As Paris taxi drivers staged another protest in January 2016, Uber's then-CEO, Kalanick, wrote in a group text message that the risk of violence against its drivers should not be a deterrent: \"I think it's worth it.. Violence guarantee success,\" and added \"these guys must be resisted, no?\" \"I believe that particular instruction from Travis was dangerous and selfish,\" a former Uber executive told The Guardian. \"He was not the guy on the street who was being threatened, who was being attacked.\" During the 2016 protests, a Paris lawyer acting on behalf of Uber sent an email asking to set up a meeting with the French prime minister, referring to the \"tense context\" of \"violent action\" by taxi drivers. Kalanick's spokesperson said he never suggested that Uber should take advantage of violence at the expense of driver safety. Kalanick's lawyers denied he exploited violence by taxi drivers to try to obtain regulatory changes beneficial to Uber. Kanalick resigned as CEO in 2017 amid scandals of sexual harassment, racial&nbsp; discrimination and bullying within the company that had not been addressed under his watch.&nbsp; Hazelbaker, a spokeswoman for Uber, told ICIJ that Uber completely changed how it operates in 2017 after facing high-profile lawsuits and government investigations that led to the ouster of Kalanick and other senior executives.&nbsp; \"We have not and will not make excuses for past behaviour that is clearly not in line with our present values,\" she said, adding that the \"kill switch\" has not been used to thwart regulatory action since 2017 and such software \"should never have been used\" that way. Powerful allies In France, Uber was not only facing angry cab drivers but also a hostile government that was not very welcoming of Uber's model and law-skirting attitude.&nbsp; But the ride-hailing giant had an ace in its pocket.&nbsp; On Oct. 1, 2014, a new law came into force imposing longer training for Uber drivers and banning Uber Pop, a popular service that allowed drivers with smaller cars to offer ride-hailing services.&nbsp; The same day, top Uber leaders, including CEO Kalanick, held a confidential meeting with Emmanuel Macron, France's minister of economy and industry at the time. Coming out of the meeting, the Uber leaders were ecstatic. \"In a word: spectacular [...]&nbsp;a lot of work to come but, but we'll dance soon,\" MacGann, Uber's top lobbyist in Europe, wrote in an internal email to colleagues. \"Wicked meeting with Macron this morning. France loves us after all.\" In October 2015, regional authorities in Marseilles banned Uber drivers from operating in the city's downtown core, around train stations and the airport. MacGann reached out by text message to Macron.&nbsp; \"Could you ask your cabinet to help us understand what is happening?\" Macron answered: \"I will look into this personally. Give me all the facts and we will decide by this evening. Stay calm at this point, I trust you [...]&nbsp;let's stay in touch.\"&nbsp;&nbsp; That evening, the head of local national police began to reverse course, promising to clarify the order. Twelve days later, authorities issued a new order saying that the ban applied to unlicensed and unregulated Uber drivers in the jurisdiction. Authorities denied receiving any pressure from Macron's ministry. Internally, Uber took credit for the reversal. \"Ban reversed after intense pressure from Uber,\" said a leaked email. In response to ICIJ's questions, Macron's office said the French services sector was in upheaval at the time because of the rise of platforms like Uber, which faced administrative hurdles and regulatory challenges. The office did not respond to questions about Macron's relationship with Uber. Hired former government officials In 2016 alone, Uber had a proposed global lobbying budget of $90 million US, according to the leaked documents. It paid friendly academics who published favourable research. It hired an army of former government officials and political staff around the world, including in Canada. Adam Blinick, currently senior director of public policy and communications, was initially hired onto Uber's Canadian public policy team less than a year after quitting the Stephen Harper government as deputy chief of staff and director of policy to the public safety minister.&nbsp; A spokesperson for Uber Canada said that Blinick was not involved with any matters related to Uber while in government and that he checked with the Office of the Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner prior to accepting his first role outside government.&nbsp; Jean-Christophe de Le Rue served as communications director to the federal public safety minister from 2013-15 before heading to Uber as a senior communications associate. An internal email noted he \"will be helping us win hearts and minds, particularly in Quebec and Alberta. He will certainly have plenty of battles to fight \u2014 with court injunction and regulatory proceedings in Edmonton and tax authority raids and hundreds of car impoundments in Montreal.\" De Le Rue didn't respond to CBC/Radio-Canada. The leaked files also show the global scale of Uber's ambitions. Memos mention hundreds of thousands of dollars in spending on consultants and lobbyists in countries like the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Ghana, Kenya, Jordan and Nigeria."

    "body": "Last September, Hamilton firefighters rescued&nbsp;a man in his 20s inside a burning, boarded-up building owned by McMaster University. Shortly after arriving at the hospital, he died. The home was part of a set of buildings between Dalewood and Forsyth avenues slated to become the site of a new school residence building. Glenn De Caire, McMaster's director of security and a former police chief, previously said people managed to get into the buildings despite them being boarded up, fenced off and having security regularly patrol the area. But security reports obtained by CBC Hamilton through a freedom-of-information request show there was another&nbsp;fire at one of those&nbsp;houses just four days before and yet another 18 days before \u2014 and the man who died in the fire was the person behind all of them. The reports have lawmakers and homelessness advocates calling for more supports and funding for mental health services and housing to prevent more people from falling through the cracks and repeating potentially fatal actions.&nbsp; \"This is a poster-child story of people who die on our streets,\"&nbsp;said Sandy Shaw, member of provincial parliament for Hamilton West \u2014 Ancaster \u2014 Dundas with the Ontario New Democratic Party.&nbsp;\"Where are people supposed to go? Where are people supposed to sleep?\" \"It's so sad. 20, he's a kid \u2026 that's somebody's kid, somebody lost a child.\" What do we know about the man who died? Details about the young man are sparse. Security reports before and after the fire include his name and aliases he used, but are redacted. The unredacted portions of the reports describe the man as unhoused and \"a marginalized member of the community.\" They also say&nbsp;he had a \"long history\" of thefts, starting fires and mental health issues. After he died, the documents say his identity was confirmed not by family or friends, but by police officers who knew him. Hamilton Fire Department, Hamilton Police Service (HPS), McMaster University and the office of Ontario's Fire Marshal all refused to do interviews for the story and wouldn't provide further details about the man. The&nbsp;Office of the Chief Coroner didn't respond to requests for interview or comment. \"The same individual was believed to have broken into the home a few different times,\" reads an emailed statement from McMaster University. \"The individual was not connected to the university and managed to gain access to the empty house, despite daily patrols from our security services and ongoing measures like fencing and fence repairs to keep people out.\" CBC Hamilton contacted numerous mental health, shelter and housing service providers asking about the man, but none offered any details. The first fire In addition to revealing&nbsp;little about the man himself,&nbsp;McMaster security documents also do not reveal how much support he may have received, despite evidence that he continued to enter buildings in the area and that his actions inside resulted in fires.&nbsp; The first fire took place on Sept. 10 at a McMaster-owned home on Forsyth Avenue South \u2014 just steps away from the other house where the man would eventually die. First responders found the man and one other person in the house on Forsyth without any injuries, according to the report. The documents and images from the scene show the fire started from a stack of newspapers and magazines in the corner of a room on the second floor which \"began to smolder through the floorboards.\" \"It was undetermined if the magazines were used as a heat source for cooking or to keep warm,\" read the documents. Police ruled it an accidental fire caused by drug use, rather than an arson. They noted the man was \"crying at times\" and security&nbsp;\"had concerns about his mental health.\" The second fire The second fire took place on Sept. 24&nbsp;at 47 Forsyth Ave. S. \u2014 just four days before his death. It's unclear if this is the same home as the first fire or if it's the home right beside it. The reports say security arrived and found&nbsp;police and fire at the scene, dousing the building with water and tearing down parts of the charred home. The home was empty at the time, but the reports say firefighters spotted the man in his 20s inside the fenced area of the house that burned that day. Jackie Penman, an HPS spokesperson, told CBC Hamilton officers were called to a fire at 47 Forsyth and said it was \"deemed non-suspicious.\" The final fire The final fire took place at 111 Traymore Ave., on Sept. 28. Fire Chief Dave Cunliffe said at the time&nbsp;there was heavy fire on the second level and a hole in the floor. Cunliffe said firefighters found the man, removed him using a ladder and had paramedics take him to the hospital where he died. The McMaster documents say first responders and security believed this was the same man who set the other two fires. The report&nbsp;notes the man's troubled past and states police apprehended him as recently as Sept. 13. The Ontario Fire Marshal investigated the fire as well, but declined to share its results with CBC. 'They have no other choice' Shaw said while the incidents may have happened at McMaster, the situation spans far beyond campus. She called this case a \"perfect storm.\" \"The whole point is why does this person have to break into those homes and try to keep themselves fed or warm?\" \"There's no stable housing, there's no emergency housing and no crisis and mental health interventions,\" she said, pointing to how services like Hamilton Mental Health Outreach have closed in recent years. Maureen Wilson, city councillor for the McMaster area and the rest of Ward 1, pointed to how Hamilton became the latest Ontario city to declare a state of emergency related to homelessness, opioid addiction and mental health. \"It's a collision of a housing system that is clearly showing it's not working, married with \u2026 Hamilton has an above-provincial average of opioid use.&nbsp;We have extreme pockets of poverty \u2026 also an income crisis,\" she told CBC Hamilton. Statistics from the city's website shows there aren't enough shelter beds and rooms to accommodate the number of unhoused people in Hamilton. While there's a group of local health-care professionals tracking the number of , it seems there is no one tracking how many&nbsp;fires are linked to homelessness. Gessie Stearns, a member&nbsp;of the team tracking the deaths, said multiple&nbsp;people have died from&nbsp;fires, and there's been a \"concerning\"&nbsp;rise in \"violent and unusual\" deaths among that population.&nbsp; The group tracks the number of deaths by collecting information&nbsp;from community sources, but the data around fires may be incomplete.&nbsp; \"We're troubled by those instances and have a lot of questions about what is being done about it,\" she said. Stearns said without better data and transparency, it's harder for people to understand the gravity of the problem and harder to see the people who are hit hardest. Hamilton fire, police, St. Joseph's Healthcare Hamilton, Hamilton Health Sciences and the Fire Marshal's office all said they don't track how many fires are linked to homelessness. Shahriar Shahrokhi, a burn surgeon at Hamilton General Hospital, said despite this, tracking is possible. \"We can figure out who has been injured and whether it came from a fixed address or not,\" he said. Shahrokhi&nbsp;said, from his observation it appears fires involving people experiencing homelessness have been on the rise, noting how the homeless population has grown in recent years, nearly doubling in three years. Hamilton's fire department didn't say if it has seen a rise in fires related to homelessness and said the vast majority of people who die in fires are residents or guests of a home. Shahrokhi said he has seen a rise in fires in encampments because people couldn't use flammable objects around tents safely. \"We call it unsafe but they have no other choice when your options are being outdoors in -20 C or trying to warm yourself up \u2026 so you don't freeze to death,\" he said. \"That's not much of a choice.\""

    "body": "It was during a visit to the 2014 Snowboard Jamboree at&nbsp;Stoneham Mountain Ski Resort, north of Quebec City, that a light bulb went off for Fran\u00e7ois Boucher. The phys-ed teacher&nbsp;noticed a bunch of broken snowboards that had been tossed in the garbage. Boucher had been looking for a way to launch&nbsp;a&nbsp;ski and snowboard program at Chanoine-Beaudet high&nbsp;school, the school&nbsp;where he teaches in Saint-Pascal, Que., in the Lower St. Lawrence. With limited school funding and ski mountains hours away, the&nbsp;phys-ed teacher had a hard time finding ways to raise the money. But once&nbsp;he saw those discarded snowboards, Boucher&nbsp;started brainstorming with his students to find new uses for them. SkisR\u00e9cup \u2014 a name that plays on the French phrase for&nbsp;\"what you can recycle\" &nbsp;\u2014 was born: the students began transforming old skis and snowboards into coffee tables, benches and coat racks. \"Since 2015, we've been&nbsp;raising&nbsp;around $1,500&nbsp;annually \u2014 enough to take the students on seven ski trips each year,\" Boucher said. The program raises enough to pay&nbsp;for the transportation and ski lift costs for the 35 students who participate. Boucher, who previously worked as a ski coach, knows how expensive it can be to get&nbsp;to ski resorts. \"I really wanted to make sure children from less fortunate families would get to enjoy this sport,\" the teacher said. Skis and snowboards contain metal, resin, fibreglass, wood, glue and plastic, making them particularly hard to recycle, said Boucher. \"When ski companies and people throw away their skis or snowboards, they don't realize that these objects don't disintegrate. They stay permanently in landfills.\" Recycling every component of the skis and snowboards became central to SkisR\u00e9cup's vision. \"We try to reuse everything \u2014&nbsp;we don't buy any screws;&nbsp;we re-use the ones from the skis,\" said Boucher. Ten&nbsp;students enrolled in the program spend their lunch hours at the SkisR\u00e9cup workshop. They are part of a specialized learning program that aims to help students with learning difficulties. Under the supervision of their gym teacher, the students take off the bindings, sort through the skis, sand and paint wood, and assemble the benches. There are hundreds of skis lined up in their workshop. Several of the student-run business's partners now&nbsp;send them used equipment, including Ski Town in Brossard and the Canadian division of ski manufacturer&nbsp;Rossignol. \"It takes two to three weeks for the whole team to do a bench,\" said Boucher. \"A lot of dedication and ingenuity goes into it.\" The students are also commissioned to&nbsp;make&nbsp;custom pieces using people's personal&nbsp;skis. Boucher said these signature pieces&nbsp;are often intended for&nbsp;buyers' cottages. Ski resorts also put in special orders. The program has become so popular, Boucher regularly sees students standing in front of his door, eager to join. \"Students get a sense of security here. It helps them feel part of a community, creates a sense of belonging,\" Boucher said. It was exactly that team spirit that convinced \u00c9douard Beaulieu to sign up. \"Working at the shop looked fun, and I get to hang out with my friends,\" he said, \"I love to snowboard, and I thought recycling skis was a great way to lower the cost of skiing.\" When J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Lajoie joined the team, he was excited to trade the classroom for a workshop. \"I wanted to do something other than mathematics and French, understand how to sand, repair, build furniture, and how to work in a wood shop,\" he said. Boucher said the program has helped students who don't necessarily enjoy the traditional school setting. \"They are kids that want to join the job market early and want to do physical tasks.\" Boucher said one of his students&nbsp;who was having a particularly hard time following the curriculum came back to thank him after leaving school in Secondary IV. He had found work in a wood manufacturing shop right there in Saint-Pascal. \"He was so proud \u2014 he was going to have a family, a car and everything he needed \u2014 it was something,\" Boucher said, clearly moved by the story. SkisR\u00e9cup already has a few contracts lined up for the season. Boucher&nbsp;hopes the venture will inspire other schools to include technical and professional programs in their curriculum. \"Not everyone wants to do post-secondary studies, become doctors or professors,\" he said.&nbsp;\"Schools need to support a wide range of individuals exercising different professions.\""

    "body": "We've been bopping to \"uh oh, uh oh, uh&nbsp;oh, oh&nbsp;no&nbsp;no\" for twenty years. On July 12, 2003, Beyonc\u00e9's   topped the Billboard charts, stayed at number one for eight weeks, and then continued to remain a top party anthem to this day.  was a hot topic on&nbsp; &nbsp;where I, along with fellow critics and pop culture enthusiasts&nbsp;Sarah-Tai Black and Kathleen Newman-Bremang, pondered the impact Beyonc\u00e9 made with both the lead single from her first solo album and the accompanying video, where she struts on to the scene in short shorts and red pumps as Jay-Z yells out \"history in the making.\" The stakes were high. This was Beyonc\u00e9 stepping out from her role fronting Destiny's Child, in the shadow of such monumental hits as   and  . At the time, I was among the doubters who wondered whether Beyonc\u00e9's singing talents really measured up to fellow Destiny's Child member Kelly Rowland, or whether her popularity among the group could be chalked up to the colourism that still plagues the industry. And then there was Beyonc\u00e9's new relationship with Jay-Z \u2014 \"Ms. Bug-A-Boo hooking up with Mr. Big Pimpin?\" \u2014 the age and power gap between them turning heads. Beyonc\u00e9, who we now know doesn't shy away from people's opinions and skepticism, addressed that head on with a banger where she sings \"your love got me looking so crazy right now.\" Admittedly, I wasn't as enthralled with this early work. Beyonc\u00e9's talent was undeniable \u2014   and the album   struck me as fun and lovely \u2014 but there was nothing there as piercing as  . For a lot of us, Beyonc\u00e9 truly stepped into her greatness a decade later with her self-titled album, following that up with  and  , which felt like earth-shattering events. Those were albums that plumbed Black history and art, and reformed Queen Bey's identity against that continuum. Newman-Bremang cites  , Beyonc\u00e9's pulsating celebration of Blackness, as the superstar's greatest single (agreed!). \"And the video was it's own cultural phenomenon,\" says Newman-Bremang, who then puts   at a close second. While I was dismissive 20 years ago, it's easier to see what Beyonc\u00e9 was bringing to the table in retrospect.   has all the elements that we would celebrate about her in the coming decades. The daring Texas-born songstress, who would open up about household indiscretions on  while mixing it up with hidden talents like Big Freedia, was already hiding in plain sight in 2003. She made herself vulnerable on songs like  , putting her relationship with Jay-Z out there for the world to see, addressing the haters while earnestly celebrating what they have going and how that will shape who she is going forward. Her debut solo album also had the eclectic mix of genres we know her for, between  's pop Red Bull uplift, the more 90s R&amp;B style song cries \u2014 like  and the title track   \u2014 and the dancehall inflections on  , which the  panelists had some minor disagreements on. Abdelmahmoud, Newman-Bremang and Black all suggest the collaboration with Sean Paul a year after he dropped   boosted Beyonc\u00e9's profile. Sean Paul's   had just topped the Billboard charts in May 2003. I argue that Sean Paul \u2014 while huge from Jamaica to Toronto since '98 when  was playing in every basement jam \u2014 was not yet as huge with American listeners until Beyonc\u00e9 introduced him to a whole new demographic that wasn't yet getting with  , much like she did with J. Balvin, Burna Boy and Megan Thee Stallion. The bottom line is, Queen Bey never played into our expectations. She has been playful with her music and reaching across genres for top collaborators since 2003. Some of us just took forever to notice. When I listen to   now, those blazing horn riffs really do sound like a triumphant arrival."

Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti said Los Angeles was \"on the brink\" of new widespread stay-at-home orders as Los Angeles County continued to see the state's largest increase in confirmed coronavirus cases. California reported on Saturday its fourth-highest daily total of newly confirmed coronavirus cases, with more than 9,000. Appearing on CNN Sunday, Garcetti was asked about a Los Angeles Times editorial that criticized the rapid reopening of California, which was followed by a spike in new COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations. \"I do agree those things happened too quickly,\" Garcetti said, adding that the decisions were made at the state and county levels, not by city officials. But he also said people in general had become less vigilant about taking precautions to avoid transmission. \"It's not just what's open and closed,\" he said. \"It's also about what we do individually.\" Infections have been soaring   including California, Florida, Texas and Arizona, with many blaming a haphazard, partisan approach to lifting lockdowns as well as the resistance of some Americans to wearing masks.

Marco Rubio called for consistent, nonpartisan messaging. \"We've seen a lot of these things turned into sort of a partisan fight or a political statement,\" he told South Florida television station, CBS4, on Sunday. Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine, like Rubio a Republican, said he would not rule out a statewide mandate on wearing masks, as infections in his state grew. He has already issued such orders in 19 counties accounting for nearly 60 per cent&nbsp;of the state's population. Globally, the World Health Organization said that 259,848 new infections were reported Saturday, its highest one-day tally yet.  , which has now confirmed more than a&nbsp;million infections, on Sunday reported a 24-hour record of 38,902 new cases. Pope Francis said \"the pandemic is showing no sign of stopping\" and urged compassion for those whose suffering during the outbreak has been worsened by conflicts. In Europe, where infections are far below their peak but local outbreaks are causing concern, leaders of the 27-nation   haggled for a third day in Brussels over a proposed 1.85 trillion-euro ($2.87 trillion Cdn) EU budget and coronavirus recovery fund. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said there is \"a lot of good will, but there are also a lot of positions\" in the talks, which have have laid bare divisions about how the countries hit hardest by the pandemic, such as Italy and Spain, should be helped. She said the talks, which were initially scheduled to end on Saturday, could still end without a deal. Confirmed global virus deaths have risen to more than 603,000, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. The United States tops the list with more than 140,000, followed by more than 78,000 in Brazil. Europe as a continent has seen about 200,000 deaths. The number of confirmed infections worldwide has passed 14.3 million, with 3.7 million in the United States and more than 2 million in Brazil. Experts believe the pandemic's true toll around the world is much higher because of testing shortages and data collection issues. Even where the situation has been largely brought under control, new outbreaks are prompting the return of restrictions. Following a recent surge in cases,   made the wearing of masks mandatory in all public places and told non-essential civil servants to work from home. Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam said the situation in the Asian financial hub is \"really critical\" and that she sees \"no sign\" that it's under control. , police in Barcelona have limited access to some of the city's beloved beaches because sunbathers were ignoring social distancing regulations amid a resurgence of coronavirus infections. Slaughterhouses also have featured in outbreaks in the U.S., Germany and elsewhere. Authorities in northwestern  Vechta county said 66 workers at a chicken slaughterhouse tested positive, though most appeared to have been infected in their free time. An earlier outbreak at a slaughterhouse in western Germany infected over 1,400 and prompted a partial lockdown. Cases in the  state of Victoria rose again Sunday, prompting a move to make masks mandatory in metropolitan Melbourne and the nearby district of Mitchell for people who leave their homes for exercise or to purchase essential goods. Victoria Premier Daniel Andrews said those who fail to wear a mask will be fined 200 Australian dollars ($190 Cdn). \"There's no vaccine to this wildly infectious virus and it's a simple thing, but it's about changing habits, it's about becoming a simple part of your routine,\" Andrews said. What's happening with coronavirus&nbsp;in Canada The federal government has said it's not OK for the Blue Jays  during the COVID-19 pandemic. Ottawa informed the team of the decision on Saturday, citing concerns over the public health risks associated with Major League Baseball's plan for a 60-game season. Marco Mendicino, minister of immigration, refugees and citizenship, told CBC News Network that the circumstances did not warrant a border-crossing exemption, particularly in light of the amount of cross-border travel needed and the risks that remained. The plan called for the Blue Jays and visiting teams to cross the Canada-U.S. border regularly.&nbsp; As of 4 p.m. ET on Sunday, Canada had 110,340 coronavirus infections. Provinces and territories listed 97,051 of those as recovered or resolved. A&nbsp; &nbsp;of deaths based on provincial reports, regional health information and CBC's reporting stood at 8,882. Ontario added 164 new cases Sunday for a total of 37,604 cases. The province also added 113 new recoveries for a total of 33,407 recoveries. Quebec announced on Saturday that masks are now mandatory in indoor public spaces across the province.&nbsp; The new measure is kicking in as the province witnesses a slow but steady increase in the number of COVID-19 cases. \"It's better to wear a mask than to be confined at home,\" Premier Fran\u00e7ois Legault said as he   last Monday. \"It's not fun wearing a mask, but it's essential.\" The new directive, which applies to people aged 12 and older, coincided with tens of thousands of Quebecers spanning out on vacation with the beginning of the traditional two-week construction holiday. Quebec is the first province to mandate face-covering, despite criticism from some who say the government shouldn't have a blanket policy when most regions outside Montreal weren't deeply affected by COVID-19.&nbsp; Nova Scotia&nbsp;and Newfoundland and Labrador logged no new infections on Sunday.

The 65-year-old Hamilton woman painted on a pink nose and black whiskers and&nbsp;slipped into an Easter bunny outfit. While most people opted to stay in because of the ongoing pandemic, Smith&nbsp;stood outside of her store, Kool&nbsp;Stuff Toys at King Street E. and Gibson Avenue,&nbsp;to dance, sing and blow bubbles and kisses to people passing by. \"I'm a child at heart,\" she said. \"I do this for me as much as I do it for the children.\" Smith stresses she's not the real Easter bunny \u2014 just a friend \u2014 but that didn't stop cars from honking at her and families from visiting her. Devon Bristo&nbsp;visited with his wife Chrissy, their five-year-old daughter Leighlah, and eight-year-old daughter Rayne. \"It's nice to see something to smile about and bring the kids joy,\"&nbsp;Bristo said. \"We were just going to spend another day at home.\" Karri and Hugh Henry, 36 and 34, also bumped into Smith. Karri has been preoccupied thinking about her grandfather, who stays in Anson Place&nbsp;\u2014 a nursing home in Hagersville where at least&nbsp; \"If my grandfather&nbsp;got sick, I'd be devastated, because I wouldn't&nbsp;be able to be there to say goodbye,\" Karri said. It made seeing Betty Bunny all the more meaningful. \"She's awesome,\" Karri said. On Saturday, Smith drew all over her own van and had her husband Jeff drive her up and down different streets. They honked at children before Smith got out of the van to wave and hop around, all while munching on a carrot along the&nbsp;sidewalk. \"During this virus, I say, 'Would you like a bite of my carrot?' And then I say, 'I can't share it, because it's [Justin Trudeau's] rule, we can only hug people and share with people that live in our house,\" Smith said. \"I have bubbles and in the van, I have a jar of Lysol wipes, but I've taken the wrapper off it and written 'Magic' all over it&nbsp;... I very theatrically wipe [the bubbles]&nbsp;without touching them before giving them away.\" Smith's&nbsp;front yard was also filled with Easter decorations. Smith said she's been dressing up&nbsp;for the past 45 years, also posing as an&nbsp;elf during Christmas. \"My mother passed away on my 20th birthday and I had to make things more beautiful then, so I've been doing this,\" she said. \"It's what brings me back to who I am, my cup is always half full ... Worry is like a rocking chair \u2014&nbsp;it gives you something to do but never gets you anywhere.\""

    "body": "The heaviest rain since record-keeping&nbsp;began 140 years ago drenched Asian financial hub Hong Kong on Friday, killing two people and injuring more than 140, state media reported, as unusually wet weather caused by typhoons brought more disruption to southern China. As of 8:15 p.m. local time&nbsp;Friday, 144 residents aged between eight and 94&nbsp;were injured amid the heavy rainfall, the Hong Kong government said in a statement. Videos showed water cascading down steep hillsides in the former British colony, flooding waist-deep in narrow streets, and inundating malls, metro stations and tunnels. The extreme weather also brought chaos to the nearby Chinese city of Shenzhen, a tech hub of more than 17.7 million people, with business and transport links hit across the economically important Pearl River Delta. \"I've never seen scenes like this before. Even during previous typhoons, it was never this severe. It's quite terrifying,\" said Connie Cheung, a 65-year-old assistant nurse in Hong Kong. The torrential rain was brought by Typhoon&nbsp;Haikui, which&nbsp;made landfall in the Chinese province of Fujian on Tuesday. Although it later weakened to a tropical depression, its slow-moving clouds have dumped huge volumes of precipitation on areas still soaked by rain from a super typhoon a week earlier. The weather bureau issued the highest \"black\" rainstorm warning and said more than 200 millimetres of rainfall was recorded on Hong Kong's main island, Kowloon and the northeastern part of the city's New Territories from late Thursday. The alert was lowered by 6 p.m. local time but authorities warned of risks from ongoing flooding. City leader John Lee said he was very concerned about the severe flooding in most parts of the territory and had instructed all departments to respond with \"all-out efforts.\" In Hong Kong, authorities shut schools on Friday and told workers to stay home. The city's stock exchange was also closed. Eric Chan, secretary for administration, said Hong Kong's transport network was severely disrupted&nbsp;and an \"extreme conditions situation\" would be extended to midnight on Friday. Hong Kong's MTR Corp, which operates the city's rail network, said at least one line was shut while others were operating with delays.&nbsp;One video clip showed metro workers in a station wading through waist-deep waters. Some roads were partly washed out, including a main route to the city's southern beaches. Social media photos showed a&nbsp;car swallowed up by a metres-wide pothole when one section of road collapsed.&nbsp;A person taken by rescue workers to hospital was pronounced dead on arrival, a television news channel reported. Hong Kong's cross-harbour tunnel, one of the main arteries connecting the island to Kowloon, was inundated, while&nbsp;a shopping mall in the Chai Wan district was half-submerged. Some passenger and cargo clearance operations at two border points between Hong Kong and Shenzhen were suspended due to flooding. Macao&nbsp;ferry operators in Hong Kong said several sailings would be suspended to the gambling hub. Knee-deep water in Shenzhen All schools, some subway stations and offices in the Guangdong city of Shenzhen were shut on Friday. The China Meteorological Administration said heavy rain would fall until early Saturday in the central and southwestern areas of Guangdong province. A rainfall log showed 465.5 millimetres of rain fell in Shenzhen over a 12-hour period, the most since records there began in 1952. Videos showed both the exit and entry areas of the Shenzhen railway station were flooded, with trains connecting the city and the provincial capital of Guangzhou suspended. About 100 people were stranded at the station. More than 100 pigs in an area near the border with Shenzhen drowned in a flood, media reported. Residents holding onto safety lines stepped gingerly through knee-deep water in Shenzhen, videos from state media showed. Daily rainfall in the city in the Pearl River Delta, which links&nbsp;Hong Kong to China's mainland, was expected to exceed 500 mm, Shenzhen media said. Schools in 10 districts of Guangzhou were suspended for the day or had to open late, while the city of Zhuhai near Macau warned of waterlogging and landslides. The industrial city of Dongguan, north of Shenzhen, reported its heaviest rain in 15 years."

It was 15 years ago that the company was officially incorporated, and at that time, founder and artistic director   would never have been able to predict how the cultural reckoning this year would impact the way BIPOC-led artistic companies like hers would be redefined.&nbsp;&nbsp; Year after year, Smith has continued to push the boundaries of contemporary Indigenous dance, telling culturally rich stories \u2014 like   which took home five Dora awards this summer \u2014 developing countless Indigenous dancers&nbsp;and becoming the chancellor of McMaster University along the way. But despite the many successes, her artistic growth has been complex. \"Even to this very day, I have that question of, 'Am I Santee the artist or am I a Mohawk artist?'\" Smith says. \"How does society see my work and frame me?\" It's a question she's been grappling with a long time. At 11 years old, Smith moved into residence and trained at Canada's National Ballet School&nbsp;\u2014&nbsp;a program she would excel in but never complete. As a teen, she began to question whether her education was allowing her to explore her identity and realized she was \"missing home.\" So she left in search of herself and began a journey that would ultimately intertwine this cultural exploration with her artistic passion. Check out this beautiful piece by filmmaker Jonathan Elliott as Smith takes us back to where her dance career began, revisiting her first original choreography on her family land on Six Nations of the Grand River. It features original music by powerhouse  . With the support of the National Arts Centre \u2014 which has been working with a number of theatre companies to move live performance outdoors through its Grand Acts of Theatre initiative \u2014 Kaha:wi Dance Theatre presented   last month The show was an immersive experience combining 3D images mapped on the Mohawk Institute Residential School in Brantford, Ont., with a performance by Haudenosaunee dancers. Kaha:wi means \"to carry,\" and carrying her stories, her values and her community has been something Smith has been doing for a long time \u2014 all to provide a space for Indigenous audiences to see themselves on stage in an authentic way. Fifteen years later, she is also still questioning the institutions she studied in and invites us to do the same. \"Ballet has a long history of being touted as the pinnacle of artistic practice and expression,\" she says. \"I think there's a whole host of other forms, other influences, other original dances from this land that we call Canada that are really important to highlight, and that's the work that I do.\""

    "body": "Some years are better than others. For the Royal Family, this has not been one of the better ones. Many of the troubles the House of Windsor faced in 2021 show little sign of fading as the calendar turns to 2022, a year when attention will focus on marking the Platinum Jubilee to honour Queen Elizabeth's 70 years as monarch. Royal author and biographer Penny Junor says 2021 has been a very difficult year for the Royal Family. \"One thing after another has hit them,\" Junor said in an interview. \"And I think it's been a very damaging year for them.\" Most damaging, Junor said, is the combination of two circumstances.&nbsp; One is what has come from Prince Harry and Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, in California, including their  , where discussion of their life in the Royal Family raised issues of race and support for mental health, among several others.&nbsp; The other circumstance is the saga surrounding Prince Andrew and the fallout from his friendship with the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. \"Neither of these problems is going away any time soon, I don't think, and Harry is promising his memoirs [in 2022], which must be hanging over the family like the sword of Damocles,\" said Junor. \"Who knows what he's going to say. Who knows what his truth is.\" In addition to the controversies surrounding Harry, Meghan and Andrew, the Queen lost her husband of 73 years, Prince Philip, on April 9. Pandemic restrictions at the time of his death meant a small family funeral in St. George's Chapel at Windsor Castle, and much attention focused on the dignified \u2014 but lonely \u2014 figure cut by the Queen. \"Those images of the Queen sitting alone in her mask at Prince Philip's funeral became more widely iconic of the COVID-19 pandemic for those who had lost loved ones,\" Toronto-based royal author and historian Carolyn Harris said in an interview. There were moments that were more hopeful for the family \u2014 four great-grandchildren of the Queen were born this year. Junor also pointed to an increased profile for Prince William and Kate, Duchess of Cambridge. \"They've really sort of stepped up, I think, to a whole new level. They did handle the lockdown really well. I think they put out some very good messages and they gave some terrific interviews and \u2026 they were \u2026 working as a team.\" When it came to dealing with the difficulties, Junor said members of the Royal Family handled them the only way they could,&nbsp;particularly through a focus on carrying on doing what they do, whether through their charitable endeavours or bringing \"comfort and reassurance to people in times of trouble.\" The increased scrutiny on Harry, Meghan and Andrew had an impact on how others in the family have gone about their royal business, Harris added. \"We've seen \u2026 senior members of the Royal Family undertaking public engagements together, emphasizing continuity,\" she said, with an emphasis on them \"all appearing together, whether it's the G7 [in Cornwall] or the premiere of the new James Bond movie.\" Given all that has transpired this year, it's tempting to compare 2021 to another year of troubles: 1992, when three of the four marriages of the Queen's children unravelled, fire ravaged part of Windsor Castle and Elizabeth herself spoke of it being an \"annus horribilis.\" \"I think it's absolutely fair to call this another annus horribilis,\" said Junor, with a nod to the circumstances surrounding Andrew and Harry in particular, and their potential impact on Elizabeth. \"I mean, Harry has taken a swipe at everybody in the family, mostly his father.&nbsp;But you know, he also actually had a swipe at the Queen,\" she said. \"Harry did say that he thought the reason his childhood had been so difficult was because Charles was not a particularly good parent, but equally he didn't know how to be a good parent because he hadn't been well parented himself, which is a bit of a slap in the face for the Queen.\" Harris sees a distinction between 1992 and 2021 in how attention has focused on the Queen.&nbsp; \"There were questions raised [in 1992] about her relationship with her children \u2014 should she have provided them with more guidance, how had she balanced extensive travel on Commonwealth tours and public engagements while they were young \u2026 whereas in 2021, there's been a great deal of respect and sympathy for the Queen.\" The clouds hanging over 2021 ahead of the Platinum Jubilee stand in contrast to the circumstances the Royal Family found itself in ahead of the last Jubilee \u2014 the Diamond, in 2012, marking 60 years for Elizabeth on the throne.&nbsp; \"Certainly in 2011 and 2012, there was a lot of very positive coverage of the monarchy,\" said Harris, noting that Prince William and Kate had just married and done a \"very successful tour of Canada\" in the summer of 2011. Now, heading into the Platinum Jubilee, there are concerns about the 95-year-old Queen's health, Harris said, and \"questions of just how many public engagements that the Queen will undertake even within her own royal residences as she is being encouraged to rest more and more.\" Junor said she hopes the Queen will be out and about during the Platinum Jubilee, and not limited to video appearances, which she has taken to doing throughout the pandemic. \"Seventy years \u2026 is an extraordinary achievement and \u2026 she is incredibly loved.&nbsp;So I think if she shows her face at the age of 95 \u2014 96 she will be then \u2014 I think there will be huge enthusiasm for her.\" The Crown and Canada Another person noticing a difference in the anticipation of the Platinum Jubilee compared to what was seen a decade ago is Michael Jackson, president of the Institute for the Study of the Crown Canada. \"Things are much more muted, more low-key and \u2026 people like us are hoping the Platinum Jubilee will give a recharge \u2026 to the Royal Family and the Canadian Crown,\" said Jackson in an interview. The Crown in Canada has also had its difficult moments of late, with the controversy surrounding Julie Payette's time as the Queen's representative here. Payette  &nbsp;in January after a workplace review of Rideau Hall found she and her secretary presided over a toxic work environment. Payette's appointment \"did a great deal of damage to the credibility and profile of the office of the Governor General,\" said Jackson, and it's going to take a long time to recover. \"Staff morale was at rock-bottom. Work wasn't getting done. There's a huge backlog of paperwork on honours and awards and the office just lost its respect and stature [with] the Canadian people.\" Jackson looks with optimism at the appointment of Mary Simon, who was  , becoming the first Inuk in the role. And he looks with optimism toward next year's Platinum Jubilee \u2014 with an asterisk. \"At the moment, the one thing that we are concerned about is the failure [of the federal government] to announce a Platinum Jubilee medal.\" Medals have been given during previous jubilees, and Jackson said one next year would offer a chance to pay tribute to Canadians, particularly those who have contributed to their communities during the COVID-19 pandemic. \"We're thinking there's an opportunity here to honour the grassroots people in Canada, the volunteers, the unsung heroes, the first responders.\" Previous jubilees have included visits to Canada by members of the Royal Family \u2014 the Queen during her Silver (for 25 years) in 1977 and Golden (50 years) in 2002, while Prince Charles and Camilla came in 2012 to mark the Queen's Diamond Jubilee. Whether there will be a visit to Canada next year by a senior member of the Royal Family is unclear \u2014 particularly in light of the ongoing pandemic. \"I think there's a lot of uncertainty in 2022 regarding royal tours and public engagements,\" said Harris.&nbsp; \"A Platinum Jubilee would normally prompt extensive Commonwealth tours, particularly to the Commonwealth realms, by members of the Queen's family.&nbsp;But with travel advisories once again being issued with the Omicron variant \u2026 it remains to be seen.\" Visits by members of the Royal Family can have an impact on public views of the Crown and the monarchy in Canada. \"We tend to see less debate and discussion regarding the monarchy in Canada when we're not having regular royal visits,\" said Harris. \"When there are royal visits, often this prompts discussions about the Crown's role in Canada.\"        COVID's shadow over Christmas&nbsp; With the Omicron variant fuelling a coronavirus case surge in the U.K., the Queen has cancelled a pre-Christmas lunch for extended members of the Royal Family. The gathering was planned for Windsor Castle next Tuesday, but was called off as a precaution, it was widely reported.&nbsp; The decision showed that the Queen, like everyone else, is trying to navigate another COVID-19 Christmas, BBC royal correspondent Sean Coughlan  . \"It's also a public statement, as well as a private family decision,\" Coughlan said. \"A public figure leading by example, as families make their own choices about meeting at Christmas.\" The Royal Family has traditionally gathered at the Queen's Sandringham estate, northeast of London, for Christmas, although that was cancelled last year because of the pandemic. It's unclear whether the get-together will go ahead this year. The effects of the pandemic were also front and centre on a royal Christmas card. The annual greeting from Prince Charles and Camilla showed him in a candid moment, helping her adjust her face mask. William and Kate also released the photo they shared on their Christmas card. The picture, featuring them along with their three children, was taken during a vacation in Jordan earlier this year.

    "body": "This time last summer,   was scared for her life \u2014 over and over and over again. There's the story of how she landed in hospital with a leg infection, which was&nbsp;a nasty prologue to a whole other misadventure on the French River. (She was bucked into the rapids,&nbsp;slicing her shin on the rocks.) Before that, she'd survived the Ottawa and Mattawa Rivers, plus the muddy, 11 km slog of the LaVase Portages. Then came a crossing at Lake Superior, where she paddled way out into the greatest of the Great Lakes ...&nbsp;just as the weather turned murderous. She and her guide survived. Barely. Same goes for the the squall that rocked her campsite soon after \u2014 an episode that nearly drowned her on dry land. But Harris made it, completing a 70-day canoe journey from Lachine, Que., to Thunder Bay, Ont. And she did it all in a damned floor-length dress. As for why anyone in 2018 (or any year) would do such a thing, that's the big question. Because first off, Harris doesn't exactly consider herself as an athlete. \"It's not like I'm a canoeist,\" she says, calling from a hammock. \"And I tell you, I did literally no training for this trip.\" But she is an artist, one   for her  . Past projects have taken her   and the   \u2014 usually by car, not boat. \"I had initially wanted to do a kind of road trip minus the road,\" she explains, an impulse that led her to researching that quintessentially Canadian vehicle, the canoe. That's when she discovered something that inspired the whole bug-bitten, tailbone-bruising adventure. It was while she was digging up imagery from the fur trade. Says Harris: \"I would come across these paintings done by 'F.A.H.'\" Harris had never seen them before: realistically rendered scenes of voyageurs cutting through the water. And she also didn't know that the artist was a woman. Who was the woman who accompanied these men, and what did it feel like for her to do the trip?   F.A.H., or Frances Anne Hopkins, was a British painter from a wealthy artistic family. (Her grandfather was a Royal Academy of Arts member, to give you an idea.) And she's responsible for most, if not all, known images of Canada's fur-trading routes. In 1858, Hopkins arrived in Quebec as a newlywed. Her (much older) husband was a senior Hudson's Bay Company staffer, and it wasn't long before the 20-year-old was tagging along on the occasional backwoods business trip, a habit she continued until their return to England. A rich white lady travelling by voyageur-powered canoe was weird enough, but Hopkins also produced oil paintings based on their travels. And like a Where's Waldo in petticoats, she'd drop herself into the pictures. \"I just became fascinated by the art,\" says Harris. \"Who was the woman who accompanied these men, and what did it feel like for her to do the trip?\" But also \u2014 and this is the bit that wound up being important \u2014 what was it like to be a female painter way back when? Hopkins was no hobbyist. She was the first woman to mount a major solo exhibition in Montreal (1870). Between 1860-1891, the Royal Academy in London exhibited her work 11 times \u2014 which might explain her gender-neutral signature. By 1860, the RA had admitted its first female student, but that particular painter (Laura Herford) crashed the gate by signing her stuff the same way. (Patriarchy, man.  .) And while reading up on Hopkins's career, Harris says she was thinking about how things have changed, but not necessarily improved, for women in art. \"Sure, I can use my name in my artwork, but when you look at the number of men who get solo exhibitions at major museums and are collected heavily, versus women. And even the pay scale! There's a huge gender disparity in the arts, and that was more where the project took me. I wanted to walk \u2014 or paddle,   \u2014 in her footsteps.\" That's what the project's ultimately about, says Harris: the life of a female artist, now and then. \"It's not about Canada, it's not about the canoe. It's about Frances Anne Hopkins.\" And inspired by Hopkins, she made several self-portraits along the trip. For the journey, which was supported by a Canada Council grant, Harris followed an HBC route the painter would have travelled (albeit in reverse). As a first-class passenger, Hopkins probably never lifted a paddle. But Harris wasn't aiming for historical re-enactment \u2014 which, frankly, would be a political minefield considering the circumstances of race and class and Red Ensign-waving imperialism that got Hopkins there in the first place. \"A lot of it was trying to empathize and put myself in her place,\" says Harris, talking about the performance. \"I wasn't pretending to be Frances Anne,\" she explains. \"I wasn't walking around speaking with an old English accent or anything. I was pretty much me, but dressed like I was out of the 1860s.\" Harris packed one costume for 70 days: a cotton dress and hat, specially made to be authentic. Despite appearances, she says it was more practical than workout gear. (\"We look at pictures of people from the olden days and we wonder, 'How did they do it?!' But you're better off when your skin isn't exposed.\") It also, miraculously, survived the trip intact. It's not about Canada, it's not about the canoe. It's about Frances Anne Hopkins.   Documenting the experience was a challenge, though. \"The hard part about being out on the water is that you can't just photograph. You can't just stop and take pictures.\" She did, however, capture a selection of portraits and landscapes. She also kept journals \u2014 unlike the real-life Hopkins. And she collaborated with artists along the way. The oval portrait above, for example, is a daguerreotype by  . Photographers from Toronto's   met up with her canoe along the French River, where they got some appropriately old-timey pictures. (The technology would have been popular in Hopkins's day.) And inspired by the studio portraits people in the 1800s would have purchased before a trip, Harris sat for \"before and after\" shots. But her journey is so not over. Next spring, Harris brings the project to the Thunder Bay Art Gallery,&nbsp;so in the coming weeks, she'll be getting back in Franny Anne's head. She's planning a repeat journey, though not by canoe this time. At a few key locations,&nbsp;she'll take photos and collect audio (she's planning a sound piece for the show). She'll also probably forage for organic bits and bobs, stuff that can be made into ink for a printmaking project. But the first stop is Thunder Bay, where she'll drop her old canoe at the museum, so it's ready for installation next year.&nbsp;&nbsp; Planning such a&nbsp;multi-disciplinary show is&nbsp;a whole new experience for Harris, an artist who's focused on photography for roughly 20 years.\" This is my opportunity to do something very different, and I want to do something very different,\" she says. \"What was the motivation? I guess with all the work I do,&nbsp;people are like, 'You're so brave!' But I don't know that I'm brave. I think I'm na\u00efve,\" she laughs. \"And I don't do my research enough to be scared.\" More selections from I, Franny Anne."

    "body": "About 172 staff members at Windsor, Ont., hospitals&nbsp;have been suspended without pay&nbsp;for not getting their COVID-19 shots by the deadlines set out by their employers.&nbsp; Windsor Regional Hospital (WRH) and H\u00f4tel-Dieu Grace Healthcare&nbsp;(HDGH) both have policies mandating&nbsp;that as of Wednesday, Sept. 22, all staff and physicians must have had at least one dose of the vaccine to continue working unless an approved exemption is provided.&nbsp; WRH confirmed in a news release that 96 per cent of its employees are fully vaccinated, but&nbsp;as of Wednesday, 140 employees plus seven professional staff members had&nbsp;not complied, with&nbsp;84 of them considered clinical staff. The staff who have not complied are now also placed on a two-week unpaid leave.&nbsp; An official at HDGH confirmed the hospital has a 96 per cent vaccination rate. However, as of Wednesday morning, 32 employees have been suspended without pay.&nbsp; The CEO of WRH said&nbsp;the&nbsp;decision was made to put the safety and well-being of patients, the community and team members first. \"We're very pleased that 3,398 of our employees or 96 per cent of our employees are doubled vaccinated or are following the policy,\" David Musyj said during a media briefing Wednesday.&nbsp; Despite the shortage on staff, Musyj said the hospital is prepared. \"We'll be able to cope without them, I hope,\" he said.&nbsp; \"As it stands now, having them continue with us, the risk is too high given the statistics and given the type of population Windsor Regional Hospital cares for.\" &nbsp; Karen Riddell, chief nursing executive at WRH,&nbsp;said her team has been working for months on staffing contingency plans and have been able to up levels. \"During the first wave of the pandemic, with us not having access to the vaccine, we saw a significant impact to our staffing and to our bed capacity because of outbreaks,\" said Riddell.&nbsp; \"Those outbreaks really occurred because we don't have the tools we do now, including the vaccine to help prevent transmission.\" Riddell said she hopes more employees will choose to get&nbsp;vaccinated.&nbsp; Meanwhile, the suspended employees at HDGH have until Oct.&nbsp;6 to get their first vaccinations, or face \"termination with cause,\" according to a representative. Staff at WRH&nbsp;have until Oct.&nbsp;7 to do the same, or face termination&nbsp;or having&nbsp;their privileges suspended. Erie St. Clair hospitals agree to same policy All five Erie St Clair hospital organizations in southwestern Ontario&nbsp;\u2014&nbsp;including Bluewater Heath in Sarnia, the Chatham-Kent Health Alliance&nbsp;and Erie Shores Healthcare in Leamington&nbsp;\u2014&nbsp;agreed to the same policy.&nbsp; However, each hospital set its own deadline on the vaccination policy.&nbsp; As of Wednesday,&nbsp;Chatham-Kent Health Alliance is reporting 88 per cent of&nbsp;staff are fully vaccinated, while another five per cent are partially vaccinated. A spokesperson for the hospital explained that 95 per cent of all physicians there are fully vaccinated.&nbsp; The Chatham-Kent hospital said they have given staff members until Oct. 31 to be fully vaccinated.&nbsp; At Erie Shores Healthcare, staff and physicians who have not been fully vaccinated are getting COVID-19 tests twice weekly. The hospital has given its staff until Oct. 4 to provide proof of having received at least one vaccine dose. The hospital said as of Wednesday, 95 per cent of staff have at least one dose.&nbsp; No details were available Wednesday about how many staff&nbsp;at Bluewater Health have complied with the policy. The hospital's deadline is Oct. 31.&nbsp;"

We'll take a look at some of them here and follow up on others in future editions of the newsletter.&nbsp; How much will the royal visit cost taxpayers? When it comes to what readers who responded would like to know about next week's visit by Prince Charles and Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, one question&nbsp;was top of mind for many. How much will it cost taxpayers? Canadian Heritage said Thursday via email that the cost of this tour hasn't been finalized, but final costs will be made public once the visit is over. Questions about costs of visits and security provided to members of the Royal Family when they are in Canada have emerged many times over the years. Most recently, the questions&nbsp;were over the cost for providing security while Prince Harry and his family were in Canada. CBC reported   that protecting them cost Canadian taxpayers more than $334,000 over a period of less than four years. When it comes to royal visits, tallying total costs means drawing in figures from several sources, including the RCMP and federal, provincial and territorial governments. The 2017 visit by Charles and Camilla \u2014 their most recent trip to Canada, and similar in length, at three days \u2014 had a cost of $487,661.68 for Canadian Heritage, the federal department said. This included:                        Those numbers don't include security costs.&nbsp; For the eight-day visit by Prince William and Kate, Duchess of Cambridge, in 2016, the RCMP said it spent about $2 million in policing costs. Records showed that its largest expenses for the visit to British Columbia and Yukon involved pay, overtime and travel costs, which totalled about $1.9 million. The B.C. government said its costs for the visit came in at slightly more than $613,000, including the $45,206 tab for the Royals flying to and from Canada from the United Kingdom, along with travel costs while they were in British Columbia. The federal government had budgeted $855,600 for the tour, and Yukon's Department of Tourism and Culture reported costs of $11,755 for the time William and Kate were in Carcross and Whitehorse.&nbsp; We'll continue to follow up on costs for next week's trip. What about Indigenous issues? We heard from several people who were focused on Indigenous issues, and wondered what Prince Charles may say or do on that topic while in Canada, whether that might involve a mention of reparations, or an apology. There's no doubt scrutiny will be high on this during the visit. Several scheduled engagements focus on or include members of Indigneous communities.&nbsp; The official public welcoming ceremony in St. John's on Tuesday will feature Mi'kmaw music and a prayer in Inuktitut. While visiting Government House, the official residence of N.L.'s lieutenant governor, Charles and Camilla will take part in a moment of reflection and prayer at the Heart Garden, which honours the memory of Indigenous children who were lost to the residential school system, survivors and families of both. On Thursday in the Northwest Territories, Charles and Camilla will visit Dettah, a Dene First Nation community about 25 kilometres outside Yellowknife. According to the trip itinerary, Charles will take part in a discussion with local chiefs and elders. He'll also participate in a discussion on Treaty 11, its history and legacy in the Northwest Territories. A focus on the environment Several of you had the environment and climate change front and centre among your thoughts. Charles has had a personal interest in the environment and sustainability since the early 1970s \u2014 even though he was mocked for it at the time \u2014 and has long been calling for action to protect the Earth and fight climate change.&nbsp; Questions you'd like to pose to him include his views on what Canadians could do to live more sustainably and what the country's priorities on the environment should be. As with Indigenous issues, there is little doubt what Charles says and does on this topic will be under heavy scrutiny during the trip. \"The Prince of Wales has long believed that we need to learn from Indigenous peoples around the world how better we should live in and care for nature and the planet,\" Clarence House said in a news release when the itinerary was announced.&nbsp; \"Canada is seeing the impact of climate change and so this tour will highlight an emphasis on learning from Indigenous peoples in Canada as well as a focus on working with businesses to find a more sustainable way of living with global warming.\" Where are Charles and Camilla going? Where can I see them in Ottawa?&nbsp; Some of you had specific questions about the itinerary for the visit and how it would have been determined. It's a short visit \u2014 three days \u2014 which is the current trend for such tours. It's in marked contrast to visits of years gone by that lasted several days \u2014 and decades ago could go for weeks and extend from coast to coast. It's not the royals who direct where they will go on these official visits. \"The government of Canada is completely in control of [Charles's] itinerary, his guest lists,\" said Nathan Tidridge, a high school history, civics and Indigenous studies teacher in Waterdown, Ont., and vice-president of the Institute for the Study of the Crown in Canada. \"It's the Prime Minister's Office through [Canadian Heritage] that makes those decisions.\" Other members of the Royal Family sometimes come to Canada on lower-profile working visits that may focus on their charitable interests or patronages. \"You see that with [Prince Edward and Sophie, Countess of Wessex]. They're here quite a lot and they do a lot of work with Indigenous Nations,\" said Tidridge. \"We don't ever hear about it, but they've been here 30 times or something like that.\" This visit by Charles and Camilla starts in St. John's on Tuesday, then sees Charles and Camilla in Ottawa on Wednesday and the Northwest Territories on Thursday. Ottawa, as the national capital, frequently turns up on any royal tour. With these shorter visits, it has become the practice to spread out the destinations among the provinces and territories from one trip to another. This visit, which is part of efforts to mark the Queen's Platinum Jubilee and 70 years as monarch, seems more focused on specific issues and current events. (There is, for example, a meeting in Ottawa with Ukrainian Canadians, where Charles and Camilla will hear their stories and about Canadian efforts to support the people of Ukraine amid the Russian invasion.) There is a Platinum Jubilee reception at Rideau Hall in Ottawa on Wednesday evening, but none of the big spectacle, state-dinner-style&nbsp;moments that were hallmarks of tours years ago. The Ottawa portion of the visit includes an appearance at 10:50 a.m. ET Wednesday at the National War Memorial for a wreath-laying ceremony. You can read more about the trip itinerary  . You can also read more   about the nature of royal visits, particularly in the wake of the controversial visit by Prince William and Kate, Duchess of Cambridge, to the Caribbean earlier this year. The future of the monarchy and Canada's ties to it On the future of the monarchy, several of you would ask Charles about his&nbsp;own priorities \u2014 broadly for the institution and for Canada specifically. Several of you also said the time has come for Canada to sever ties with the monarchy, seeing it as an outdated, colonial institution. Others want to stay firmly connected, seeing strength in its continuity and form of government, as a contrast to places such as the United States. One specific question on your mind here is how Canada could hypothetically cut its relationship with the monarchy. We've looked at this issue a few times in recent months, particularly after Barbados cut its ties with Queen Elizabeth last fall. Philippe Lagass\u00e9, a constitutional expert and associate professor at Carleton University in Ottawa, told our CBC colleague Jackson Weaver that it would be much more difficult to do the same in Canada.&nbsp; For Canada to amend its Constitution and replace the Queen as head of state, it would need to enact Article 41(a) of the Constitution Act of 1982. That   requires a majority approval from \"Senate and House of Commons and of the legislative assembly of each province\" \u2014 meaning all 10 provinces would need to agree (though not the territories). While a referendum is not legally required, Lagass\u00e9 told Weaver it's incredibly unlikely any \u2014 let alone all \u2014 would move forward without one. Even then, that's far from the only thing standing in the way. First, as Canada's current governing party is far from the majority that Barbados Prime Minister Mia Mottley's enjoyed, it would be virtually impossible to change Canada's governmental system \u2014 even if a vote did pass. \"As we saw when it came to efforts to amend the Constitution in the past,\" Lagass\u00e9 said, \"individual members have mechanisms at their disposal where they could delay or potentially derail that effort, even if a majority of members \u2026 might be in favour.\" Read more about this   and  . A monarchy in transition Some of you are wondering about the transition to Charles as King, with questions such as how he and the Queen are preparing for it. One vivid reflection of the transition played out in London this week, as Charles read the Queen's speech for the state opening of the British Parliament. Queen Elizabeth missed the opening for the first time in nearly 60 years. In the announcement that she wouldn't be on hand this time, Buckingham Palace noted the mobility issues the 96-year-old monarch has been having for the past few months, which have seen her miss several public appearances and events. Charles's reading of the speech was the latest in a growing number of events and responsibilities various members of the Royal Family have been assuming gradually for the past few years. Craig Prescott, a constitutional expert at Bangor University in Wales, said Charles's reading of the speech is a \"significant moment\" in the transition from the Queen to her heir. \"The Queen's speech is one of the most important ceremonial occasions in the U.K.,\" Prescott said via email. \"It's the start of the parliamentary year, and reflects the constitutional importance of the monarchy.\" However, Prescott said, the Queen is \"still very much in charge\" and deals with state papers every day. \"Only now, due to her age, some set-piece, ceremonial occasions, such as the Queen's speech, will now be left to other members of the Royal Family, especially Prince Charles.\" The \"real significance\" of the moment, Prescott suggested, is the glimpse it offers into the future, \"of what the monarchy will look like when Charles becomes King.\" \"This might even further the stability of the monarchy, as people are prepared for the time when Charles takes to the throne, as they can see him performing aspects of the role.\" Royally quotable \"As someone who lives with his own grief, I also know that what often matters most to the bereaved is that those we have lost are not forgotten.\"&nbsp; \u2014 Prince William  , Diana, Princess of Wales, who died in 1997, during the unveiling of a memorial to those killed five years ago in the attack after an Ariana Grande concert in Manchester.&nbsp; Royal reads           "

    "body": "For years, ultra-wealthy Canadians \u2014 aided by&nbsp;high-priced accounting and tax law firms \u2014&nbsp;have been setting up offshore shell companies in the Isle of Man so&nbsp;they can dodge&nbsp;taxes back home, avoid paying future creditors   and hide their identities. Now, MPs on the House of Commons finance committee appear ready&nbsp;to try to dismantle that shield of&nbsp;secrecy. Politicians from all parties agreed early in May to open  into Isle of Man tax shelters. They were reacting to&nbsp;recent reports suggesting&nbsp;the&nbsp;self-governing British Crown dependency's strict confidentiality laws did&nbsp;more than&nbsp;help rich Canadians avoid&nbsp;taxes \u2014 that they&nbsp;  embezzle more than $500 million from investors. Global accounting firms have mostly managed to keep their clients' names secret by arguing that&nbsp;their codes of conduct prevent&nbsp;them from publicly naming the multimillionaires behind the shell companies they&nbsp;helped to&nbsp;set up. But when KPMG Canada's head of tax, Lucy Iacovelli, testified before&nbsp;the House of Commons finance committee on May 6, she immediately found herself sparring with MPs&nbsp;from&nbsp;across the political spectrum. MPs wanted to know the&nbsp;details of&nbsp;a secret offshore tax scheme the Canadian accounting firm set up starting in the late 1990s \u2014 one that Canada Revenue Agency officials&nbsp;called a \"sham ...&nbsp;intended to deceive\" federal authorities. KPMG says it stopped selling the plan in the mid 2000s after&nbsp;acknowledging its problems.&nbsp;At the same time, many of the shell companies KPMG&nbsp;helped to set up remained active for more than a decade afterwards, until the plan was detected by the Canada Revenue Agency. Iacovelli's refusal to name the Canadians behind the Isle of Man shell companies KPMG set up drew sharp rebukes from MPs on the committee.&nbsp;Bloc MP Gabriel Ste-Marie warned&nbsp;KPMG&nbsp;that it \"cannot refuse to provide this information.\"&nbsp;&nbsp; KPMG now has until the beginning of June to voluntarily comply with the request.&nbsp;MPs have the power to subpoena documents and witnesses. CRA offered secret deal to KPMG clients KPMG has a long history of opposing requests to name the beneficial owners of offshore companies it helped to create. In 2013, it appealed a judge's order to provide&nbsp;names to the Federal Court of Canada, citing client confidentiality. That case dragged on for years.&nbsp;The CRA eventually KPMG's wealthy clients that promised them no penalties if they paid back taxes and did not tell the public about the agreement. KPMG now says it has complied with a judge's ruling in late 2016 to give CRA&nbsp;its list of clients.&nbsp; Still, the judge recognized that KPMG was permitted to advise&nbsp;its unnamed clients that they could, as a next legal step, try to claim solicitor-client privilege over certain documents held by the accounting firm. In at least   that's exactly what happened.&nbsp; In an email exchange from as far back as 2002, KPMG accountants revealed plans to route communication on tax shelter arrangements for billionaire brothers Caleb and Tom Chan outside of Canada as much as \"humanly possible,\" and through a law firm that might allow the players to \"claim solicitor/client privilege.\" Questioned by Conservative MP Ed Fast during her committee appearance, Iacovelli declined to state&nbsp;that KPMG created the offshore \"product\" to reduce taxes for its clients. She told Fast&nbsp;the answer to his question&nbsp;was \"very complex\" and couldn't be reduced to a&nbsp;\"yes or no.\" \"I hate it when accountants try to hide behind complexity to avoid answering questions,\" Fast replied. 'They are trying to cover up' MPs&nbsp;grilled&nbsp;Iacovelli over KPMG's&nbsp;statements denying&nbsp;that it helped to&nbsp;set up four companies in the Isle of Man two decades ago&nbsp;suspected of involvement in a massive fraud.  reported earlier this year that the four companies named after ancient swords \u2014&nbsp;Katar, Spatha, Sceax and Shashqua \u2014&nbsp;are suspected of&nbsp;involvement in a&nbsp;fraud operating out of Montreal known as the Cinar/Norshield/Mount Real affair. Leaked emails from an Isle of Man service provider&nbsp;say that KPMG helped to set up those&nbsp;companies for wealthy Canadian clients.&nbsp;Iacovelli and KPMG vehemently deny&nbsp;that claim and say&nbsp;that the author of the emails was mistaken. The emails were contained in an offshore leak of financial data obtained by the German newspaper S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung and shared with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists. CBC/Radio-Canada also reported that other documents from the Isle of Man's public registry show links between the so-called \"sword companies\" and KPMG. A company that KPMG acknowledges it did set up \u2014 Parrhesia \u2014 was registered in the Isle of Man at the exact time and date that three of the sword companies were registered. The Isle of Man's public registry also lists sequential corporate numbers for Parrhesia and those sword companies. Iacovelli said CBC/Radio-Canada has been sent a notice of libel after publishing these details. Iacovelli told MPs that a thorough search of KPMG records found nothing to connect it with the sword companies. \"Any implication that KPMG was in any way involved with the sword companies ...&nbsp;is false,\"&nbsp;she testified. \"I don't believe you at all,\" responded&nbsp;Ste-Marie, citing the proximity between KPMG's Parrhesia and the sword companies. \"They are trying to cover up,\"&nbsp;NDP finance critic Peter Julian observed after the hearing. MPs on the&nbsp;committee say they're determined to identify&nbsp;the Canadians behind the sword companies and find out&nbsp;who helped to&nbsp;set them up. 'We are not going to give up' That's the assurance they gave&nbsp;Janet Watson, a victim of the Cinar/Norshield/Mount Real fraud&nbsp;who lost her retirement savings and who has fought on behalf of other victims for years. Watson testified that some of her&nbsp;fellow investors&nbsp;had to go back to work in their 70s, experienced&nbsp;marital breakdowns&nbsp;and suffered&nbsp;stress-related illnesses.&nbsp; She said&nbsp;she knows of at least&nbsp;one who committed&nbsp;suicide. \"Where did all the money go?\" she asked MPs. \"I would like to tell you that we're going to do everything we can to get to the heart of this,\" Ste-Marie told Watson. \"We are not going to give up ...&nbsp;regardless of the time that it will take.\" \"We owe it to the many victims of this massive fraud and the associated tax evasion, and secretive transfers of funds, to get to the bottom of what transpired here,\" said&nbsp;Julian. Julian&nbsp;said he planned to call Serge Bilodeau, KPMG Montreal's senior partner, to testify before MPs&nbsp;about Parrhesia and its proximity to the sword companies. Offshore 'nominees' protecting identities of wealthy Canadians So who did help set up the sword companies, if not KPMG?&nbsp;Public documents in the Isle of Man's registry provide the names of numerous offshore directors and officials who could solve the mystery. Those names include former KPMG employees Sandra Georgeson and Anne Couper Woods. Woods and Georgeson are listed as directors of numerous KPMG companies set up in the Isle of Man for wealthy Canadians, and are&nbsp;named in the sword company documents.&nbsp;Georgeson is the author of the leaked emails&nbsp;that&nbsp;said KPMG Canada helped to&nbsp;set up the sword companies. Woods was&nbsp;made a director of a company called \"KPMG CEE Management Services Limited\" in 2004, when she was also&nbsp;a director of the sword companies. Michael Morris, a Canadian living in Nassau and running the Barrington Bank, is listed as a director of one of the sword companies, Shashqua, with&nbsp;Woods and Georgeson.&nbsp;Morris was also identified in the Cinar/Norshield/Mount Real scandal as&nbsp;having helped Ronald Weinberg, a Montreal business executive,  . The documents also show that Susan Gibbons, a Canadian working in Bermuda, was on the board of Katar, Sceax and Spatha. Gibbons' boss, William Maycock, is also listed as the person who transferred funds out of three of the sword companies. Maycock was educated at Dalhousie University in Halifax and McMaster University in Hamilton and was, or is, a member of the Canadian Tax Foundation.&nbsp;Today, he runs a Bermuda-based trust company. KPMG Canada did not respond specifically&nbsp;to CBC's&nbsp;questions about whether it made efforts to contact Morris, Gibbons&nbsp;or Maycock before determining that&nbsp;no one at the accounting firm had any involvement with the sword companies. \"We repeat that we are confident in our thorough and well-considered diligence, particularly but not limited to our detailed review of the best source of information \u2014 our own records \u2014 which confirmed KPMG Canada had no involvement in the Sword companies,\" the company said in a media statement. In an email to CBC/Radio-Canada, KPMG Canada also said&nbsp;that when&nbsp;Iacovelli denied any association with the sword companies, she was referring only&nbsp;to KPMG Canada. KPMG&nbsp;is headquartered in the&nbsp;Netherlands but it&nbsp;bills itself as a network of firms \u2014&nbsp;each with its&nbsp;own legal liability. Iacovelli \"attended the Finance Committee meeting as a representative of KPMG Canada (and her comments, like ours, rightly reflect KPMG Canada's position),\" KPMG&nbsp;media relations officer Tenille Kennedy&nbsp;wrote in an email to CBC's&nbsp; Kennedy declined to state&nbsp;whether anyone at&nbsp;KPMG's Isle of Man offices \u2014&nbsp;including its former head of tax, Greg Jones \u2014&nbsp;knew about the sword companies. KPMG Canada and its lawyers&nbsp;frequently&nbsp;point&nbsp;to an \"independent\" report the company&nbsp;commissioned from&nbsp;former Supreme Court judge Ian Binnie. It states&nbsp;that the sword companies, along with&nbsp;other&nbsp;shell companies identified by journalists, \"are not clients of KPMG.\" Binnie wrote his report before the&nbsp;Isle of Man emails&nbsp;stating the sword companies were KPMG&nbsp;clients&nbsp;became public. &nbsp; Binnie later said he spoke with KPMG Canada's legal counsel about the leaked emails and did not see a reason to change his conclusion. Binnie said KPMG had obtained many&nbsp;records from the Isle of Man in advance of his review. \"I have no reason to doubt the due diligence undertaken by KPMG,\" Binnie wrote CBC/Radio-Canada in an email. KPMG&nbsp;Canada has declined to say&nbsp;whether the accounting firm&nbsp;provided&nbsp;Binnie&nbsp;with the corporate documents for&nbsp;Parrhesia when the retired judge conducted his 2017 review. When asked recently about Parrhesia and the swords being set up at the same time, Binnie&nbsp;said&nbsp;they could have been set up together simply because the Isle of Man service provider&nbsp;put together a \"batch\" of documents that were then physically delivered to the Isle of Man public registry at the same time."

    "body": "The team at the Montreal Botanical Garden&nbsp;has been busy this summer, harvesting&nbsp;more than 2,300 bins of fresh produce for the city's food banks. The project was launched in the spring when the pandemic-spurred economic shutdown cost people their livelihoods and, in turn, put a heavy burden on food banks, which&nbsp;suddenly had long lines forming at their doors. Horticulturists expanded the garden's&nbsp;vegetable patch from&nbsp;1,100&nbsp;to 1,800&nbsp;square-metres, allowing them to double the&nbsp;usual amount of produce they donate each year. They&nbsp;chose squash,&nbsp;cucumbers, tomatoes and other plants that grow in abundance to ensure there would be plenty to donate.&nbsp; \"It was very demanding physically for the back. But, in general, it was very satisfying. It was really a summer like no other,\" said&nbsp;Isabelle Paquin, a horticulturist with the garden. Anne Charpentier, director of the Botanical Garden, said the Edible Garden is usually a display of a wide variety of vegetables. This year, the focus was on productivity and four organizations are benefiting from the harvest. \"It is wonderful that we can really produce and provide them with fresh vegetables twice a week,\" she said. Charpentier said it was an initiative of the garden's horticulturists, who early on in the pandemic wanted to respond&nbsp;to the demand for affordable, healthy food. Part of&nbsp;city's vision for urban agriculture The City of Montreal soon got involved as elected officials were searching for a way to offer food banks more fresh produce. \"At the beginning of the crisis, we realized there were a lot of people in Montreal who lost their jobs and were more vulnerable,\" said Coun. Laurence Lavigne Lalonde. Lalonde is the executive committee member in charge of urban agriculture and Space for Life, a museum district in the city's east end that includes the Botanical Garden and the Biodome. She said the city did a lot to help Montreal's homeless population weather the storm, \"but we decided we could also help people get access to fresh food.\" \"We believe the city will have a bigger role to play in food security in the years to come,\" said Lalonde. \"We are right now working on a vision for urban agriculture.\" That vision will include community gardens and farms on the West Island, she said, as the city looks to a future fraught with climate change."

    "body": "During the late 1800s and all of the 1900s, the small boat of choice along the south and southwest coasts of Newfoundland and Labrador was the dory. This versatile little craft was used for inshore fishing, carried on the decks of schooners to fish from on our offshore banks, and a means of transportation connecting many of our smaller isolated communities and also often filled the role as lifeboats on larger vessels. Simeon Lowell of Salisbury Point, Mass.,&nbsp;is credited with&nbsp;inventing&nbsp;the dory in 1793. Over the ensuing decades these small, shallow-draft flat bottom boats, measuring five to seven&nbsp;metres long, became so popular and were in such demand for fishing along the eastern seaboard that eventually \"dory factories,\"&nbsp;where they were mass-produced, were established. When the more than 450 vessels of the New England fishing fleet were looking for newer and richer fishing areas in the 1860s, they expanded their fishing efforts farther offshore to the Scotian Banks and the Grand Banks. According to Gloucester author and historian John N. Morris, \"it was on the more distant fishing grounds, the Western and the Grand Banks, that ground-trawl dory fishing first gained its foothold, and once it started it overspread the fleet by the end of the decade.\" This led to the dory being modified by making the thwarts, or rower seats,&nbsp;removable, so they could be nestled \u2014 stacked up to six deep \u2014&nbsp;and carried on the deck of the schooner to and from the offshore grounds. Around the same time schooners from Nova Scotia also took advantage of the lucrative fishing on our offshore banks followed by our own fishermen in 1891, led by Samuel Harris and at least 16 other schooner owners from Grand Bank. The increasing demand soon led to dory factories being set up in our neck of the woods: at Lunenburg and Shelburne in Nova Scotia, as well as at Bay of Islands, St. John's, Grand Bank, Monkstown and Lamaline in Newfoundland and on the nearby French Islands of St-Pierre-Miquelon. As dory building developed in other countries,&nbsp; there were attempts to improve&nbsp;the original Lowell design did occur but basically over the ensuing 200 years no major changes were made to the overall style of the first dory. Some builders did depart from the original Lowell design by, for example, raising the height of the bow or changing the slope of the stern. Local dory builders of note included brothers John and Henry Monk of Monkstown, Placentia Bay \u2014&nbsp;builders of their own designed dory for some 60 years \u2014&nbsp;James Tuff of Lamaline and Stephen Leonard Grandy of Grand Bank. \"The sturdy Monk dory was a great favourite with fishing skippers and dorymen who fished in their small 'western boats' off Cape St. Mary's , the Virgin Rocks and even out on the far flung Grand Banks,\" according to Otto Kelland, in his 1984 book  . Stephen Leonard Grandy was born in 1884 in Garnish, where shipbuilding was the major employer from the late 1800s&nbsp;until&nbsp;the 1940s. While honing his carpentry skills as a young man, he moved&nbsp;to the larger nearby town of Grand Bank, which offered more employment opportunities. Eli Harris, brother of merchant Samuel Harris, was an experienced carpenter/shipbuilder who also operated a dory&nbsp; factory&nbsp;at Grand Bank from 1905 to 1928, according to&nbsp;historian/writer Randell Pope,&nbsp;and it was there that Grandy found employment around 1918. When Eli Harris retired, Grandy&nbsp;took over the dory building and schooner repair business, serving the needs of the Samuel Harris business, which operated a large fleet of offshore fishing and foreign going vessels. In the 1930s, following the bankruptcy of the Harris empire, Grandy&nbsp;developed a mutually beneficial working relationship with another Grand Bank fishing firm, G&amp;A&nbsp;Buffett Ltd.,&nbsp;which marketed his Grandy-built dories all along the south coast. Over the years&nbsp;Grandy&nbsp;had designed a dory that he felt better suited the Newfoundland fishery, weather and ocean conditions. He raised the bow height, making the craft more seaworthy. The stem was truncated, making it safer to offload over the side of the schooner while at sea. He used only grown timbers, which were much stronger than the jointed&nbsp;timbers commonly used by other builders. In  , Kelland&nbsp;wrote,&nbsp;\"The Grandy&nbsp;was always recognized as a good carrier and an excellent seaboat. This fine dory was usually painted buff with green gunnels. I have heard nothing but high compliments paid to the Grandy, by men who are familiar with her while pursuing the Banks and shore fisheries, as well as those who have served on vessels engaged in the coastal trade.\" Stephen Leonard used an assembly-line system in his dory factory;&nbsp;all the separate parts would be manufactured and assembled, until they had enough material to build two dozen dories. Then a crew of four men, in teams of two, would assemble two dories per day. During the winter of 1934-35 G&amp;A&nbsp;Buffett&nbsp;received orders from 11 different Burin Peninsula and South Coast fishing businesses for 98 Grandy dories. Grandy's three sons joined the business by the mid-1940s,&nbsp;but not before his oldest boy, Max, had spent some time working as a foreman with the well-known Canadian shipbuilding firm of Smith &amp; Rhuland, builders of the famous racing schooner Bluenose&nbsp;at Lunenburg, N.S. The exposure and experience in the building and repairing of larger ships he brought back with him to Grand Bank and resulted in the Grandys not having to depend entirely on the building of dories to be kept busy. It was at this time that two of the brothers, Max and Roy,&nbsp;struck out on their own and began operating under the trade name Grandy Brothers Ship Repair and Dory building. According to Max's son, Harold, Grandy Brothers was a partner concern and not an incorporated company. \"Their main function at that time was building dories and also carrying out repairs to banking-schooners, employing 12 carpenters at their factory including their father, Stephen Leonard, and their younger brother, Len,\" said Harold Grandy. A 1947 newspaper article entitled \"Many Employed In Dory Building at Grand Bank\" gives details about the early days of Grandy Brothers and their growth in this subsidiary industry, having built well over 100 fishing and motor dories that year and also supplying dories for the northern seal hunt. In the 1940s and 1950s the Grandys' workshop operated at full capacity, meeting a production quota of two dories per day, each selling at $90. They built more than three thousand of them over the years. Max Grandy left the partnership in the mid-1950s to work different construction jobs until 1958, when he was approached by then provincial fisheries minister Aiden Maloney to start a boat-building yard at Marystown. After he built several long-liners there and the facility expanded to accommodate the building of larger boats he transferred to the Fisheries Loan Board as an inspector, where he stayed until he retired. Following Max's exit, the two remaining brothers, Roy and Len, reorganized the business and then operated as R&amp;L Grandy Ltd.,&nbsp;still building dories and doing larger vessel repairs but concentrating mainly on the construction of long-liners for south coast fishermen, who were now supplying product to the newly opened fresh fish plants in the area. In 1961 a grandson of Stephen Leonard Grandy, 20-year-old Jim Grandy \u2014 who had completed marine diesel studies at the Trade School in St. John's, after briefly going to sea \u2014 went to work with the firm. \"Over the years I was a jack of all&nbsp;&nbsp;trades connected with shipbuilding \u2014 some carpentry but mostly doing mechanical work such as installing engines and rudders and latterly doing the accounting end of the business,\" said Jim Grandy, now 82. That same year, the company \u2014 faced with limited space at Grand Bank to expand its operation into the building of larger vessels \u2014 moved to the nearby town of Fortune where for a few years they continued to build dories (one winter they built 40) but gradually the building of larger vessels took over their business. In July 1964 the Grandy shipbuilders launched the Frederick L. Blair. The 250-ton, 120 foot-long vessel \u2014 the largest ship ever built on the south coast of our province \u2014 was often referred to by the family as their greatest accomplishment. Carl, another of Stephen Leonard's grandsons,&nbsp;worked briefly with R&amp;L&nbsp;Grandy (from 1971 to 73) before moving to the Marystown Shipyard, following in the footsteps of his father, Len, who went to work there a few years earlier. Len had left the Grandy partnership after the completion and launching of the 65-foot fishing vessel Oderin&nbsp;in late 1966,&nbsp;built for John McGrath of St. John's at a cost in excess of $100,000 \u2014 or more than $800,000 in today's dollars. For the next 20 years Jim Grandy and his father, Roy, employing six to eight&nbsp;other carpenters, carried on the Grandy tradition continuing, to build 40- to&nbsp;65-foot long-liners and other boats at Fortune until 1987, when they&nbsp;closed up shop&nbsp;and sold their facility to the provincial government, to be used as a Marine Centre. In 1992 the Canadian Mint, to commemorate 125 years of Confederation, struck a commemorative set of silver coins \u2014 one quarter for each of the 10 provinces \u2014 giving Stephen Leonard Grandy and Grandy Shipbuilding the ultimate recognition by featuring the Grandy&nbsp;dory on the Newfoundland quarter."

Ottawa (1-0-1-0) got off to a solid start, but similar to last season struggled in the second allowing Toronto (1-0-0-1), who opened its season with a win over Boston, to take the lead. The Charge were able to bounce back in the third scoring twice in a span of 3:11 to take the lead. Toronto worked hard for the equalizer but Emerance Maschmeyer, who made 20 saves, came up big in the dying minutes. Ottawa's Mannon McMahon opened the scoring early in the first, but Toronto was able to tie the game with a power-play&nbsp; goal with Sarah Nurse tipping a Hannah Miller shot. Toronto took the lead late in the second when Izzy Daniel was able to knock home a loose puck across the goal line. The Charge were able to get its crowd back into the game in the third. Ottawa tied the game on the power play when Jincy Roese was able to get a shot through traffic from the point. The Charge regained the lead when Katerina Mrazova found space and saw Tereza Vanisova at the side of the net to redirect a shot high over Kristen Campbell, who made 28 saves. Takeaways Charge: Ottawa's focus in the off-season had been to build up its size and grit but far too often they were outmuscled in front of its own net. Sceptres: Toronto struggled to contain Ottawa after they tied the game in the third. Key moment After tying the game early in the third the Charge were able to build off the momentum and score the go-ahead goal. Key stat Jincy Roese's tying goal in the third period was her first PWHL career goal. Up next Sceptres: Host the Minnesota Frost on Saturday.
